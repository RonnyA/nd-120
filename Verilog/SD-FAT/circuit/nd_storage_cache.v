** nd_storage_cache - tag / LRU directory for the shared block cache       **
**                                                                         **
** Phase 4 of the storage facade. docs/nd-storage-design.md section 2.1    **
** named "the Phase-4 tag-based cache" but never specified it; this module **
** and the engine changes that use it ARE that specification.              **
**                                                                         **
** WHY                                                                     **
**   v1 mapped a client block straight onto a region block in one line     **
**   (nd_storage_engine.v: s_blk_abs <= slot_base + op_block), so an image **
**   could never exceed its slot and the mount refused size > slot. A real **
**   Winchester image is 75 MB against a 256 KB slot. The region is 2048   **
**   blocks = 4 MB and cannot be widened cheaply (s_blk_abs is [10:0] and  **
**   feeds mem_addr into ND120_CORE / ND3202D / MEM_43), so the region     **
**   stops being a COPY of the image and becomes a CACHE of it: every      **
**   block of an arbitrarily large image is reachable and the resident set **
**   is whatever the guest is actually touching.                           **
**                                                                         **
** WHAT IS CACHED                                                          **
**   Per client, via CACHE_MASK in nd_storage: 1 = through this directory, **
**   0 = DIRECT (block requests go straight to the card, region untouched).**
**   Tape and floppy are DIRECT - the card is quick enough for them, and   **
**   caching them would spend region on devices that do not need it. The   **
**   disc classes (SMD, Winchester) are CACHED because SINTRAN's working   **
**   set is what decides whether the machine feels quick. Enabling the     **
**   floppy later is one bit in CACHE_MASK and nothing else.               **
**                                                                         **
** ORGANISATION                                                            **
**   ONE SHARED pool over all cached clients, not a fixed window per unit: **
**   the tag carries the client id, so the disc doing the work gets the    **
**   whole pool and an idle second unit costs nothing.                     **
**                                                                         **
**     line         = one 2048-byte region block (the block granularity    **
**                    the whole stack already uses)                        **
**     set index    = client_block[SETIDX-1:0]                             **
**     tag          = { client[2:0], client_block[BLKW-1:SETIDX] }         **
**     region block = POOL_BASE_BLK + set*WAYS + way                       **
**                                                                         **
** STORAGE SHAPE - the thing that decides whether this fits the FPGA       **
**   ONE array. A set's tags AND ranks AND valid bits live in a single     **
**   word, so a set is one registered read, all ways compare in the same   **
**   cycle, and the whole directory is a single-clock BSRAM with one write **
**   port. Two rules that are not optional:                                **
**                                                                         **
**     - NEVER reset the array with a loop over its entries. That infers   **
**       flip-flops instead of block RAM; at 512 sets it cost ~26k flip-   **
**       flops in the first version of this module, more than the part     **
**       has. The mass clear is a WALKING clear instead (SETS cycles after **
**       reset), invisible because the first open spends hundreds of       **
**       thousands of cycles in SD card init before any lookup arrives.    **
**                                                                         **
**     - NEVER split rank or valid into their own arrays read              **
**       combinationally. The second version did exactly that, because the **
**       valid bits need a mass clear, and it measured 187283 AND gates at **
**       512x4 under yosys/synth_gowin - tens of thousands of LUT4 on a    **
**       part with 20736, nearly all of it the SETS-deep read multiplexer  **
**       and write decoder that an indexed FF array builds per bit. Folded **
**       into the BSRAM word there is no multiplexer at all.               **
**                                                                         **
** ONE OUTSTANDING LOOKUP                                                  **
**   The engine serializes: one granted client, one block op at a time. So **
**   there is no pipeline hazard here and no bypass network - IDLE -> RD   **
**   -> CMP and back. A lookup costs 3 cycles, which is noise against the  **
**   four-sector card read a miss then performs.                           **
**                                                                         **
** LRU                                                                     **
**   2 bits of rank per way per set: 0 = most recently used, WAYS-1 =      **
**   least. A hit or a fill promotes its way to 0 and pushes every way     **
**   that outranked it down one. The victim is the way at rank WAYS-1.     **
**   Invalid ways are taken before any valid way, so a cold pool fills     **
**   before it evicts anything. Ranks are read-modify-written in CMP.      **
**                                                                         **
** WRITE POLICY                                                            **
**   Write-through, write-allocate. The engine commits to the card FIRST,  **
**   then the region copy, then reports done - the existing ordering rule, **
**   so a failed CMD24 never leaves the region holding data the card does  **
**   not have. No dirty bit and no writeback exists here, which is what    **
**   makes a reset or a card pull safe at any instant.                     **
**                                                                         **
** INVALIDATION                                                            **
**   inval_req drops every line of one client - used when a client is      **
**   re-opened (card swap, remount) so lines from the old file cannot      **
**   survive into the new one. Walks the sets, two cycles each, and only   **
**   ever runs at open.                                                    **
