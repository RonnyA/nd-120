  # --- meta: the suite checks itself first ---------------------------------
  # Every testbench in the tree must be reached by an entry below, or be
  # baselined in tests/tb_catalog.py with a reason. Fails when a new testbench
  # is written and never registered - the drift that left 9 testbenches
  # unreachable before 08-AUG-2026.
  "tests :: test-tb-catalog :: TB_RESULT: PASS"
  # The silicon path must be flip-flop mode on every board. "no fucking
  # latches i fucking told you" had to be said repeatedly; a latch-mode
  # silicon build invalidates whatever it was measuring, so the rule lives in
  # a check instead of in someone's memory.
  "tests :: test-no-latches :: TB_RESULT: PASS"
  # one microcode, everywhere: every PROM-image copy matches Code/Microcode
  # (dated exceptions only) - the 895f360 sim-vs-board split detector
  "tests :: test-microcode-sync :: TB_RESULT: PASS"
  # --- Terminal core (board-independent console: screen + keyboard) ---------
  # 800x600@60 VGA timing: counts a whole frame and checks pixels, lines, both
  # sync widths and the polarity. A wrong polarity is a monitor saying "no
  # signal" with nothing else to go on, so it is checked rather than eyeballed.
  "Terminals/sim :: test-vga-timing :: TB_RESULT: PASS"
  # Stage A glass TTY: printable characters, CR/LF/BS/HT/FF, wrap at column 80
  # (the 80th character IS written) and the hardware scroll - top_row advances
  # and the newly exposed bottom line comes back blank.
  "Terminals/sim :: test-terminal-ctrl :: TB_RESULT: PASS"
  # PS/2 keyboard: 11-bit framing, odd parity (a bad frame is DROPPED - a
  # corrupted scancode can leave shift stuck on), press-vs-release, shift,
  # caps-lock-on-letters-only, ctrl. It does NOT prove the scancode->ASCII
  # table, which can only be checked by typing on a real keyboard.
  "Terminals/sim :: test-ps2-keyboard :: TB_RESULT: PASS"
  # Console UART loopback, run at BOTH framings the machine can be programmed
  # to (7E1 and 8N1). The 7-bit path shifts the byte down out of the top of the
  # register - the step that silently mangles every character if DATA_BITS is
  # wrong, which on hardware looks like "the terminal shows garbage" with
  # nothing to point at.
  "Terminals/sim :: test-console-uart :: TB_RESULT: PASS"
  # The whole console loop end to end, board pins removed: a byte serialized
  # by a stand-in machine survives framing, deserialization, the clock-domain
  # crossing, the control state machine and the address arithmetic to land in
  # the right character cell - and a PS/2 key press comes back out of the
  # machine's own receiver as the right character, THROUGH the idle-high AND
  # merge. Every piece passing alone proves nothing about them being wired the
  # right way round, which is what costs a bitstream build and a trip to the
  # hardware.
  "Terminals/sim :: test-console-loop :: TB_RESULT: PASS"
  # The pixel pipeline, checked EVERY pixel of four frames (1,920,000) against
  # a model built independently in the testbench from the same font file. Not a
  # spot check: this module is a 2-clock fetch pipeline, the hardware-scroll row
  # mapping and the cursor/attribute inversion at once, and each fails in a way
  # that looks almost right - a pipeline off by one just shifts the picture.
  # The testbench also counts the pixels it compared and FAILS if the count is
  # short, because the first version scanned a window inside vertical blanking
  # and cheerfully reported "0 wrong" over zero pixels.
  "Terminals/sim :: test-text-screen :: TB_RESULT: PASS"
  # The power-on message sender. Checks the properties that hold whatever the
  # text says rather than re-listing the message (the message is generated, and
  # a second copy is a second thing to forget): it never offers the 0x00
  # terminator - a REGRESSION, the first version registered `valid` and leaked
  # the NUL for one cycle - it honours backpressure, and it goes silent forever
  # once done, so it can never collide with the machine's own output later.
  "Terminals/sim :: test-banner :: TB_RESULT: PASS"
  # The operator panel. Checks properties rather than comparing a rendered
  # frame - a model of the renderer would just repeat the renderer's own
  # misunderstandings. Bounded region on all four sides (a region-maths error
  # silently eats the console text above it), zero pixels claimed when disabled,
  # and the level afterglow both FADES and EXPIRES. That last one is a
  # regression test: the first decay constant took 28 minutes, which would have
  # shown every level permanently lit and looked entirely plausible.
  "Terminals/sim :: test-panel :: TB_RESULT: PASS"
  # the panel's MIPS counter - window arithmetic, idle clear, saturation
  # (30-AUG-2026, with the MIPS field on the panel)
  "Terminals/sim :: test-mips-counter :: TB_RESULT: PASS"

  "Terminals/sim :: test-key-vt100 :: TB_RESULT: PASS"
  # TDV2200 (type 93, default terminal, 31-AUG-2026) key-sequence expander -

  "Terminals/sim :: test-key-tdv2200 :: TB_RESULT: PASS"
  # TDV2200 PS/2 -> ASCII path end to end: bare C0 bytes for arrows/Home/
  # Delete (no marker at all, unlike VT100), ESC[nn_ markers for F-keys
  "Terminals/sim :: test-ps2-keyboard-tdv :: TB_RESULT: PASS"
  # TDV2200 display controller - C0 table, DLE binary cursor addressing
  # (both encodings), EOT/EM erase, and the REAL captured PED-at-type-93
  # startup sequence replayed byte-exact (DCS soft-key blocks skipped
  # without leaking to the screen, zero-padded CUP, ED)
  "Terminals/sim :: test-terminal-ctrl-tdv :: TB_RESULT: PASS"
  # --- MiSTer core ----------------------------------------------------------
  # The board-specific console glue, NOT the terminal core (that is above). The
  # three things tested here exist only on this board and each fails in a way
  # that still looks plausible on a screen: the toggle->strobe edge detector on
  # hps_io's ps2_key, the pressed/release polarity flip, and the source
  # priority between banner, machine and local echo. The echo check types a
  # 'q' specifically because the banner text contains no 'q' - the first
  # version typed 's', found one in the banner's own word "this", and would
  # have passed with the echo path completely dead.
  "fpga/mister/sim :: test-console :: TB_RESULT: PASS"
  # CPU liveness probe printed on the MiSTer console (ND120_DIAG_PRINT).
  # DIAGNOSTIC SCAFFOLDING - retire this entry together with the module once

  # the MiSTer build compiles those sections, so a divergence is invisible to

  # On 01-SEP-2026 the predecessor arm (an altsyncram megafunction, deleted
  # since) shipped outdata_reg_a="CLOCK0", giving the WCS a two-clock read
  # (altsyncram registers the address as well): every microinstruction

  # The target builds nd_storage_disc_adapter_tb.vvp from
  # nd_storage_disc_adapter_tb.v - a file that has NEVER been tracked in git.
  # It was renamed to nd_storage_smd_adapter_tb.v in commit b8dd72d
  # (10-AUG-2026) and neither the Makefile target nor this line followed, so
  # the entry could not build. Nobody saw it because the FIRST registry entry
  # (test-tb-catalog) was itself red, which aborted the whole fail-fast run
  # before reaching this line.
