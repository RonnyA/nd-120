"""
Testbench catalogue and coverage report.

Answers three questions that were previously answered by guessing:

  1. Which testbenches does `make test` actually RUN?
     (Not "how many entries are in the registry" - one registry entry can run
     several testbenches, and a testbench can sit in the tree with nothing
     pointing at it.)

  2. Which testbenches are ORPHANED - they exist, they may even build, but no
     registry entry reaches them, so they never run and can rot silently.

  3. Which circuit modules have NO testbench at all.

How it works: every registry line names a directory and a make target. This
walks that directory's Makefile, resolving the target through its
prerequisites and recipe lines (and through aggregate targets like `test-all`),
collecting every *_tb binary or *_tb.v source it reaches. That set is what
`make test` really exercises.

Run:  python3 tests/tb_catalog.py            (report)
      python3 tests/tb_catalog.py --check    (report + fail on new orphans)

Exit 0 on pass, 1 when an orphan appears that is not in the ORPHAN_BASELINE.
