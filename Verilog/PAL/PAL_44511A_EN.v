      //           /CUP := /CWR * MREQ + /CUP * /MREQ <-- ':=' registered
      //
      // In PALASM '=' is a combinational output and ':=' a registered one, and
      // on a PAL16R4 only Q0-Q3 have flip-flops - CWR is pin B0, which has
      // none. LEV0 (B3) in this same file was already modelled combinationally;
      // CWR was not, and that was the bug.
      //
      // WHY IT MATTERED. A registered CWR is not visible until the NEXT clock
      // edge, by which time MREQ has gone. The CUP term /CWR * MREQ needs both
      // in the SAME cycle, so CUP never asserted at all. Everything followed
      // from that: the used-bit PAL never wrote, CHIP_21F stayed zero, and
      // s_hit - which requires !s_used_n - could never assert. The machine's
      // own diagnostic (CACHE-120-A00 under TPE) reported exactly that chain:
      // "CUP does not work", "DATA is NOT COPIED to DATA CACHE", used bit
      // "Expected 1 Found 0", while the cache DATA memory test passed.
      //
      // HOW IT IS MODELLED HERE (FF mode, chosen 28-AUG-2026). The set term is
      // combinational, so CWR is visible in the very cycle MREQ * WCA happens -
      // that is what CUP needs. The hold term is a register qualified by /CLK,
      // matching "HOLD UNTIL START OF NEXT CYCLE": the hold dies at the CLK rise,
      // so CWR does not survive into the high phase.
      //
      // THE HOLD TERM IS A LEVEL LATCH, SAMPLED AT SYSCLK RATE (29-AUG-2026).
      // The real pin is a feedback latch: CWR sets the instant MREQ * WCA
      // appears and stays set for the rest of the CLK-low phase, and /CUP
      // samples it at the CLK rise. The previous model loaded CWR_hold only
      // on the CLK rise itself (the EN pulse), so the only WCA it could ever
      // remember was one still present AT the rise. On this board WCA lives
      // in cycle state d (PAL 44402D: ... * CYD ...) and CLK rises at TERM,
      // four states later - by then WCA is long gone. Measured in Verilator
      // FF mode (runSim ND120_CACHE_TRACE, 29-AUG-2026): WCA=1, CWR=1, MREQ=1
      // for 4 sysclk, CWR_hold stayed 0, CUP_n stayed 1. Every cache write
      // was lost that way and CACHE-1X0-A00 test 2 reported "CUP does not
      // work", the same verdict as the Nexys board.
      //
      // Now CWR_hold is updated on EVERY sysclk: it sets on MREQ * WCA and
      // holds while CLK is low, exactly the listing's CWR * /CLK term at
      // sysclk resolution. At the EN sample CLK is still low (CLK_EN is the
      // cycle BEFORE the rise, see CYC_36.v), so CUP sees the held CWR.
