** ND-100 DMA BUS MASTER                                                 **
**                                                                       **
** The request/grant + memory-reference engine every DMA controller      **
** (floppy DMA, SMD) uses to exchange single words directly with the     **
** NORD-100 memory system. Protocol per ND-06.016.01 chapter V and       **
** docs/nd100-bus-dma.md:                                                **
**                                                                       **
**   1. Assert BREQ (wired-OR bus request) and wait.                     **
**   2. The Bus Control Unit answers with BMEM (leading edge freezes     **
**      request status) and daisy-chains OUTGRANT; the first module      **
**      with a frozen request receives INGRANT and stops the token.      **
**   3. Granted: present the 24-bit physical address on BD with BAPR;    **
**      BINPUT inactive = memory read, active = memory write.            **
**   4. Read: remove the address (no feedback), assert BDAP ("BD free,   **
**      memory may drive"); memory answers data + BDRY; strobe data on   **
**      BDRY. Write: present data combined with BDAP; memory strobes on  **
**      BDAP and answers BDRY = accepted.                                **
**   5. BDRY leading edge ends the grant; trailing edge releases the     **
**      bus. One word per allocation - block transfers re-request.       **
**                                                                       **
** BDAP driver note: the master drives BDAP in BOTH directions -         **
** verified against PAL_44902A ("PAUSE UNTIL BDAP OCCURS"), see          **
** docs/nd100-bus-dma.md section 9 gap 1 resolution.                     **
**                                                                       **
** Daisy chain: INGRANT_n in, OUTGRANT_n out. A module that is not       **
** requesting passes the token through; a claiming module consumes it.   **
**                                                                       **
** All bus signals active low; BD released = all ones. Client side is a  **
** one-word request/ack interface; the device (word counter, core        **
** address register) sits on top and re-requests per word.               **
**                                                                       **
