**  The nd100x oracle (oracle/fsi-lifi-nd100x.trace) is a capture of the    **
**  File System Investigator opening the Winchester on a machine where it   **
**  WORKS. Its opening sequence is:                                         **
**                                                                          **
**      READ  +4 status  -> 020000     idle                                 **
**      WRITE +5 control =  034005     M7 return-to-zero                    **
**      READ  +4 status  -> 060005     <-- ACTIVE, seek still running       **
**      READ  +4 status  -> 060011     on cylinder, finished                **
**                                                                          **
**  On the Tang the same session produces:                                  **
**                                                                          **
**      READ  +4 status  -> 020000                                          **
**      WRITE +5 control =  034005                                          **
**      irq                                                                 **
**      READ  +4 status  -> 060011     <-- already finished, ACTIVE never   **
**                                         observed by the guest            **
**                                                                          **
**  Every value matches the oracle EXCEPT that the guest never catches the  **
**  operation running. ND_WINCHESTER.v gives an RTZ whose arm is already at **
**  cylinder 0 a fixed 8-tick completion instead of DELAY_TICKS, and at     **
**  power-on the arm IS at cylinder 0 - so the very first RTZ any guest     **
**  issues completes in about a microsecond.                                **
**                                                                          **
**  The existing oracle bench cannot see this. It checks ACTIVE only after  **
**  CTRL_GO (a data transfer, not an RTZ), and it reads status with ZERO    **
**  latency - on the very next bus cycle. A real guest cannot do that: it   **
**  executes several instructions between writing the control word and      **
**  getting its first status read onto the bus.                             **
**                                                                          **
**  GUEST_POLL_CLKS is that latency, and it is a measurement, not a guess.  **
**  The Tang runs the CPU/bus domain at 6.75 MHz (BOARD_CLK_FREQ in         **
**  fpga/tang-nano-20k/src/tang20k_defines.v, slow variant), so one clock   **
**  is ~148 ns. A single ND-100 IOX instruction is several microcode steps, **
**  and the guest issues at least a control write and a status read back to **
**  back. 100 clocks is ~15 us - a deliberately CONSERVATIVE lower bound on **
**  how soon any real driver can poll. If ACTIVE is gone before then, no    **
**  guest can ever observe the operation.                                   **
**                                                                          **
**  This bench does NOT assert which completion delay is correct. It        **
**  asserts only what the oracle proves: the guest must be able to see the  **
**  operation running.                                                      **
