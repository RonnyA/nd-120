** ND WINCHESTER DISC CONTROLLER, 5 1/4 inch ST506 (3041) / 8 inch (3038) **
**                                                                       **
** DMA block device, IOX 500-507, ident 1, interrupt level 11.           **
**                                                                       **
** Register core made 1:1 faithful to two host-gated C implementations   **
** that are themselves proven byte-identical against each other:         **
**   nd100x  src/devices/winchester/deviceWinchester.c (synchronous)     **
**   portable lib/NDDeviceCore/src/nd_winchester.c     (phase machine)   **
** A shared conformance sequence drives both and the traces are diffed;  **
** this RTL follows the same decisions. Primary source for every rule    **
** below is ND-11.015.01, sections 2.1 and 3.1-3.5 plus 4.1.             **
**                                                                       **
** ---------------------------------------------------------------------- **
** WHY THIS CARD EXISTS ALONGSIDE ND_SMD.v                               **
**                                                                       **
** The families differ in how the 24-bit memory address and the word      **
** count are loaded, and that is what tells them apart:                   **
**                                                                       **
**   NORD-10 large disc   address ONE access,   word count ONE access    **
**   ECC (ND 558/559)     address ONE access,   word count ONE access    **
**   15 MHz SMD (ND 632)  address TWO accesses, word count TWO accesses  **
**   Winchester (this)    address TWO accesses, word count ONE access    **
**                                                                       **
** The ND-120's own MASS STORAGE LOAD microcode (PROM listing, CSA       **
** 002221-002227) writes the core address TWICE and the word count ONCE. **
** That is the Winchester pattern exactly - which is why this core needs **
** NO boot-mode special case at all. ND_SMD.v carries one (s_boot_mode,  **
** the BPUN byte-server plus the "a +1 or +7 write leaves boot mode"     **
** escape) precisely because the microcode's protocol does NOT match its **
** registers. Here the microcode drives the normal register path and a   **
** normal GO, so there is nothing to special-case.                       **
**                                                                       **
** There is also NO register multiplex bit (no CWR): every IOX offset    **
** means exactly one thing, and there is no controller-type strap - the  **
** loading protocol is fixed.                                            **
**                                                                       **
** Register map (offset from base, sec 3.1):                             **
**   +0 R  Read memory address     LO 16 first, then HI 8                **
**   +1 W  Load memory address     HI 8 first, then LO 16                **
**   +2 R  NOT USED - reads 0 ("IOX 502 Not used" in the sec 3.1 table)  **
**   +3 W  Load block address      cylinder b15-5, sector b4-0           **
**   +4 R  Read status register    READING IT RESETS THE FLIP-FLOPS      **
**   +5 W  Load control word       GO / opcode                           **
**   +6 R  Read block address      unconditional - the sec 3.1 table has **
**                                 no test-mode qualifier                **
**   +7 W  Load word count / step count   SINGLE access                  **
**                                                                       **
** NOTE the deliberate asymmetry at +0/+1: address WRITES go HI then LO, **
** address READS come back LO then HI (sec 3.2).                         **
**                                                                       **
** The upper/lower selection flip-flop is reset by ANY of four events    **
** (sec 3.2), all four implemented here: master clear, programmed device **
** clear (control b4), a status register read, and activation (b2).      **
**                                                                       **
** Control word (+5, sec 3.4):                                          **
**   b0 int-enable (on NOT active), b1 error-int enable, b2 ACTIVE (GO), **
**   b3 test mode, b4 device clear, b5-8 head, b9 unit (ONE bit - hence  **
**   two units maximum), b10 unused, b11-13 operation M0..M7,            **
**   b14 seek direction (ZERO = towards cylinder 0), b15 bad track.      **
**                                                                       **
** Status (+4, sec 3.5):                                                 **
**   b0 int-enabled        b1 error-int-enabled   b2 active              **
**   b3 finished with a device operation          b4 inclusive OR (b5-13)**
**   b5 3041: r/w during RTZ  b6 timeout  b7 disk fault                  **
**   b8 address mismatch   b9 CRC error   b10 compare error              **
**   b11 FIFO over/under-run or DMA channel error                        **
**   b12 always 0          b13 3041: always 1 / 3038: r/w gate active    **
**   b14 on cylinder       b15 always 0 - distinguishes this card from   **
**                             the 10 Mb controller                      **
**                                                                       **
** INTERRUPT (sec 4.1), the rule TPE CONFIGURATION probes with:          **
**   "If the controller is ready for an operation (status bit 3 = 1),    **
**    and interrupt is enabled (status bit 0 has been set by control bit **
**    0 = 1), the interrupt signal BINT11 will be active ... The IDENT   **
**    code may now be read by an IDENT PL11 instruction."                **
**   A CONDITION on the current status, not a pulse: activation drops    **
**   b3 and therefore drops the line, which returns at completion. The C **
**   port shipped once without this and TPE reported "No identcode found **
**   on level 11D, expected identcode : 1B".                             **
**                                                                       **
** HARDWARE-CONSTRAINED DIVERGENCE, same as ND_SMD.v: the C models       **
** pre-check that a unit is ATTACHED and (for writes) not WRITE-         **
** PROTECTED using media metadata. This core has no backend metadata     **
** port, so those two faults arrive as disk_err_in during the transfer   **
** and become the same terminated-with-error result. The address-        **
** mismatch bound (b8) IS pre-checked against the GEO_* parameters.      **
**                                                                       **
** MEDIA FILES: this card's images are WDn.IMG, NEVER SMDn.IMG.          **
**                                                                       **
** Thumbwheels (both level 11, sec 3.1):                                 **
**   tw0 disk system 1, base 00500 ident 001                             **

**   one card or the other, never both.                                  **

  //   1. Every non-idempotent side effect fired once PER SYSCLK for the
  //      duration of the access. The +0 read alternator (s_ma_read_ff) and
  //      the +1 write alternator (s_ma_write_ff) toggled N times instead of
  //      once, so which half of the memory address register you got depended
  //      on how many clocks the bus cycle happened to last.
  //
  //   2. Even toggled exactly once, toggling at the START of a read changes
  //      iox_rdata WHILE the bus is still sampling it: the master sees the
  //      other half. The alternator therefore advances on the END of the
  //      access (s_rd_end), so the selected half is stable for the whole

  // already defines for this card. They are listed verbatim in this file's
  // header block under "Status (+4, sec 3.5)" and assembled into s_status
  // further down. NOTHING here is invented: this task chooses AMONG the
  // manual's bits, it never adds one, never repurposes one, and never puts
  // the reason code itself anywhere the guest can read it. That is the rule
  // in Verilog/SD-FAT/circuit/nd_storage_status.vh - the storage stack is
  // clean-room and may carry a reason code, a reproduced ND card may not.
  //
  // WHERE THE REASON CODE COMES FROM: nd_storage_engine.v tags the failure
  // at the point it happens (card timeout, CMD17/CMD24 failure, no mount,
  // block past end of file, broken FAT chain, engine watchdog), the code
  // travels engine -> nd_storage -> nd_storage_disc_adapter (the Winchester
  // reuses it at ST506 geometry) -> disk_err_code here.
  //
  // FULL MAPPING - all nine codes of nd_storage_status.vh:
  //
  //   NDS_ERR_NOCARD    b7  disk fault / missing clocks. No SD card in the
  //                         slot: from the guest's side the drive is simply
  //                         not usable, which is exactly what b7 means.
  //   NDS_ERR_NOTOPEN   b7  same bit: WD0.IMG is not on the card (or its
  //                         mount failed), so again there is no usable
  //                         drive behind the interface.
  //   NDS_ERR_RANGE     b8  address mismatch. The manual's b8 is "the
  //                         address searched for was not found on the
  //                         drive", which is precisely a block past the end
  //                         of the image.
  //   NDS_ERR_TIMEOUT   b6  timeout. The engine watchdog fired: the backend
  //                         never answered - the same event b6 exists for.
  //   NDS_ERR_CARDIO    b9  CRC error. The card answered but the data is
  //                         not trustworthy (CMD17/CMD24 error, CRC, card
  //                         stopped mid-block). b9 is this card's
  //                         data-unreadable bit.
  //   NDS_ERR_FATCHAIN  b9  same bit: the FAT chain is broken or circular,
  //                         so the medium cannot yield the requested data.
  //   NDS_ERR_WRPROT    b9  this card has NO write-protect bit in sec 3.5.
  //   NDS_ERR_WRALIGN   b9  A refused write IS a failure to write the
  //                         medium, so it lands on the general media-fault
  //                         bit. The exact reason stays readable on the
  //                         storage seam (WDISK_ERR_CODE) for a testbench
  //                         or a probe - it is only the GUEST that cannot
  //                         tell these two apart, and that is the manual's
  //                         limitation, not a shortcut taken here.
  //   NDS_ERR_NONE          never reaches this task (no error, no call).
  //
  // b4 (inclusive OR of b5-b13) follows automatically from s_incl_or, so
  // any bit chosen here also raises the guest's "something went wrong" bit
  // exactly as the manual specifies.
  //
  // WHY THIS EXISTS: before it, both call sites hard-coded ONE bit, so
  // "no SD card", "WD0.IMG missing", "block past the end of the image",
  // "broken FAT chain" and "the card stopped answering" were a single
  // indistinguishable CRC error at the guest, at the console and in a
