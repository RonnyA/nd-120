#  run_quartus_ram_equiv.sh - the Quartus RAM arm vs the reference arm       #
#                                                                            #
#  WHY THIS EXISTS (01-SEP-2026)                                             #
#  ------------------------------                                            #
#  Only the MiSTer build compiles the `ifdef QUARTUS_RAM_INFER` sections of  #
#  IDT6168A_20.v (the WCS) and MEM_RAM_49_BLOCKRAM.v (main memory). Vivado,   #
#  Gowin and Verilator all compile the plain-Verilog model instead. So a      #
#  difference between the two is invisible to every normal simulation, and    #
#  shows up only as a board that does not boot.                              #
#                                                                            #
#  That is exactly what happened to the arm's PREDECESSOR, an explicit        #
#  altsyncram megafunction (31-AUG-2026, deleted 01-SEP-2026). The WCS was    #
#  built with outdata_reg_a="CLOCK0", which gives a TWO-clock read because    #
#  altsyncram always registers the address as well (M10K cannot read          #
#  asynchronously). The plain model takes ONE clock. Every microinstruction   #
#  therefore reached the microsequencer a clock late on that board, the       #
#  sequencer ran one step out of step with the cycle controller, and a nested #
#  microsubroutine T,RETURN popped the wrong address - so MACL never resumed  #
#  and the CPU looped in the interrupt-register microcode instead of         #
#  reaching OPCOM.                                                            #
#                                                                            #
#  It went unnoticed because the equivalence check of the day compared the    #
#  megafunction against a hand-written stub (altsyncram_stub.v), which was    #
#  itself wrong by one clock in BOTH settings, so the comparison passed.      #
#  Nothing can simulate a megafunction. That is why the megafunction arm and  #
#  its stub are gone, and why the surviving Quartus arm is ordinary Verilog:  #
#  iverilog runs the code Quartus will actually build, not a model of it.     #
#                                                                            #
#  METHOD: build each testbench TWICE and diff the logged waveforms - they    #
#  must be byte-identical.                                                    #
#    ref - the plain arm Vivado, Gowin, Verilator and iverilog all build      #
#    inf - -DQUARTUS_RAM_INFER, plain Verilog restructured for Quartus        #
#                                                                            #
#  TEETH, checked 01-SEP-2026: giving the `inf` arm one extra clock of read   #
#  latency - the exact bug above - makes this script FAIL. Note that breaking #
#  its write-first BYPASS does NOT, and that is correct: during a write       #
#  regWE_n is low, so D_3_0_OUT is masked to 0 that cycle and the bypassed    #
#  value is overwritten before the mask lifts. It is unobservable at the pin. #
