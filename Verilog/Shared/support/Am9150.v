**  The Am9150 is a high-performance, static, n-channel, read/write, random-access memory organized as 1024 x 4.              **
**  It features single 5 V supply operation, TTL-compatible input and output levels,                                          **
**  and separate input and output pins for improved system performance and ease of use.                                       **
**                                                                                                                            **
**  The Am9150 also incorporates a reset feature which will reset the entire contents of the memory to logical                **
**   LOW in two cycle times by controlling /R (RESET) and /S (CS).                                                            **

**  The Am9150 has four control signals /R, /S, /W and /G.                                                                    **
**  The /S input controls read, write and reset operations of the device and provides for easy                                **
**  selection of an individual device when the outputs are tied together.                                                     **
**  The /W (/WE) input controls the normal read and write operations, and the /G (/OE)                                        **
**  controls the state of the outputs.                                                                                        **

   ** History, because this location has been wrong twice:                    **
   **  - the first model skipped the reset ("NO CAN DO WITH BLOCK RAM") and    **
   **    only gated data_out while /R was low, so CCLR was a no-op and stale  **
   **    pre-DMA lines kept hitting (24-AUG-2026, CPU_MMU_CACHE_DMA_tb.v);    **
   **  - the 24-AUG fix cleared the array with a 1024-step write sweep and    **
   **    DROPPED every external write while the sweep ran, saying that "only  **
   **    causes a spurious later miss". It did: CACHE-1X0-A00 test 2 issues a **
   **    cache clear and writes its test word within the next few hundred     **
   **    clocks, the tag and data RAMs took the write, this chip did not, and **
   **    the line stayed "not used" forever - "DATA is taken FROM MEMORY when **
   **    present in DATA CACHE", "NOT COPIED", "MIXED UP ADDRESSING" on the    **
   **    board and in Verilator alike (29-AUG-2026, runSim ND120_CACHE_WIN:   **
   **    sweep=1 at the write, used_mem=0 after it).                          **
   **                                                                         **
   ** Now: one VALID flip-flop per location. /R low clears all 1024 in ONE     **
   ** clock (the chip's two cycle times); a write sets its location's valid   **
   ** bit together with the data; a read returns 0 for a location that has   **
   ** not been written since the last reset. Nothing is ever dropped or       **
   ** swept. Power-up: the valid vector initialises to 0, so the X/random    **
   ** power-up contents of the array are never visible. Cost on the FPGA:    **
   ** 1024 flip-flops, on a board that has 126k.                              **
