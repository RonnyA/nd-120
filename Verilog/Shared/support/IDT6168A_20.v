/*

The IDT6168 is a 16,384-bit high-speed static RAM organized as 4K x 4.
It is fabricated using IDT’s high-performance, high-reliability CMOS technology.
This state-of-the-art technology, combined with innovative circuit design techniques,
provides a cost-effective approach forhigh-speed memory applications.Access times as fast 15ns are available.

The circuit also offers areduced power standby mode.
When CS goes HIGH, the circuit willautomatically go to, and remain in, a standby mode as long as CS remainsHIGH.

This capability provides significant system-level power and coolingsavings.
The low-power (LA) version also offers a battery backup dataretention  capability  where  the  circuit  typically
consumes only 1μW operating off a 2V battery. 

All inputs and outputs of the IDT6168 areTTL-compatible and operate from a single 5V supply.
The IDT6168 is packaged in either a space saving 20-pin, 300-milceramic or plastic DIP or a 20-pin LCC providing 
high board-level packing densities.

Military grade product is manufactured in compliance with the latest revision of MIL-STD-883, Class B,
making it ideally suited tomilitary temperature applications demanding the highest level of performance and reliability.


High-speed (equal access and cycle time)
  –   Military: 25/45ns (max.)
  –   Industrial: 25ns (max.)
  –   Commercial: 15/20/25ns (max.)

Documentation: https://www.alldatasheet.com/datasheet-pdf/view/65830/IDT/IDT6168.html


NOTE!! The access time is not immediate, meaning it takes 15-20 nanoseconds after the address has changed for the data to become valid on the output.

  // ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  // Quartus arm (01-SEP-2026): the SAME array and the SAME 1-clock
  // write-first behaviour as the reference below, only restructured into a
  // shape Quartus 17.0 will map onto M10K. PLAIN VERILOG on purpose.
  //
  // HISTORY - the arm this replaced. The first Quartus arm (31-AUG-2026,
  // deleted 01-SEP-2026 once this one had booted the board) was an explicit
  // altsyncram megafunction. It shipped with outdata_reg_a="CLOCK0", which
  // put a SECOND register on the output: altsyncram ALWAYS registers the
  // address in synchronous mode, so the WCS read took TWO clocks against
  // this model's ONE. Every microinstruction arrived a clock late on that
  // board alone, the microsequencer ran one step out of alignment with the
  // cycle controller, and a nested microsubroutine return popped the wrong
  // address (001015 instead of the 002027 MACL pushed) - the CPU looped
  // forever in the interrupt-register microcode. See
  // docs/mister-microcode-loop.md. Nothing simulates a megafunction, so no
  // simulation could ever have caught it; the equivalence check of the day
  // compared it against a hand-written stub that was wrong by the same
  // clock. That is why the arm below is plain Verilog and the megafunction
  // is gone: Shared/support/sim/run_quartus_ram_equiv.sh compiles and runs
  // BOTH this arm and the reference and proves them cycle-identical. An arm
  // that can be tested is worth more than an arm that is "obviously" right.
  //
  // What Quartus objects to in the reference arm (measured, build v46):
  //     Info (276007): ... uninferred due to asynchronous read logic
  // for all 32 WCS chips, then
  //     Error (276003): Cannot convert all sets of registers into RAM ...
  // because 32 x 4K x 4 bits of flip-flops does not fit any device.
  // Nothing reads the array outside the clocked block, so the read is not
  // actually asynchronous. What it cannot map is the OUTPUT REGISTER: in
  // the reference, data_out loads from the ARRAY on a read but from
  // D_3_0_IN on a write. A register fed from a non-memory source cannot be
  // the M10K's own output register, so the array read is left with nowhere
  // synchronous to land - and M10K has no asynchronous read port (the same
  // limit that forces the async cache RAMs onto MLAB).
  //
  // NOTE this is a reading of the evidence, not a rule quoted from Intel's
  // documentation. The build is the proof, and build v47 (01-SEP-2026)
  // delivered it: uninferred RAM 34 -> 1, all 32 WCS chips in M10K, and the
  // board boots to the OPCOM prompt on this arm.
  //
  // The fix: give the array read a register of its own that does nothing
  // but hold array data, and rebuild the write-first bypass outside it from
  // ordinary flip-flops.
  //
  // ramstyle "no_rw_check": a read and a write can hit the same address in
  // the same cycle. The bypass mux already supplies the new data there, so
  // whatever the M10K hands back on that cycle is discarded. Saying so
  // stops Quartus building bypass hardware we do not need.

  // Unified sim/FPGA model: posedge-clk write-first synchronous RAM.
  //
  // Both branches now use the SAME timing semantics — no `ifdef VERILATOR_SIM`
  // divergence. Read latency is 1 sysclk: address change at posedge clk N
  // produces the corresponding data at posedge clk N+1.
  //
  // Why 1 sysclk and not zero/combinational:
  //
  //   With zero-delay reads, the WCS feedback loop (WCS→CSBITS→SC5/SC6→
  //   regREP→regW→CSA→LUA→WCS) collapses entirely within one MCLK=0 idle
  //   period. The TVEC dispatch chain (o000017→o000016→o002001) resolves
  //   in delta time without intermediate MCLK pulses, and o000016 LDLC is
  //   skipped (R81 in CGA_DCD captures the wrong CSCOMM).
  //
  //   The 1-sysclk read delay forces each TVEC chain step to take its own
  //   MCLK cycle, matching how the original ASIC's WCS RAM access time
  //   (15-20ns) was a significant fraction of the original cycle period.
  //
  // Why posedge-only (not negedge writes / negedge reads):
  //
  //   The previous model had VERILATOR_SIM doing reads on posedge but
  //   writes on negedge, while the FPGA branch did BOTH on negedge — the
  //   half-sysclk shift created a sim/FPGA divergence. Unifying both to
  //   posedge eliminates the divergence and gives the same timing model
  //   in iverilog, Verilator, and the FPGA block RAM.
