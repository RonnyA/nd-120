** NDDeviceCore -> ND-120 Verilator harness ADAPTER                       **
**                                                                       **
** THE BRIDGE. NDDeviceCore (E:\Dev\Ronny\NDDeviceCore) holds the         **
** PORTABLE C99 device cores that also compile into the RP2350 NDModulE   **
** firmware. This adapter wraps ONE such core (an nd_device*) in the      **
** C++ NDDevice interface the ND-120 harness already drives, so the very  **
** same .c that runs on the controller card is exercised by the REAL      **
** ND-120 CPU + bus RTL inside Verilator.                                 **
**                                                                       **
** The mapping is 1:1 by design - nd_device_vt was modelled on NDDevice:  **
**                                                                       **
**   NDDevice::Reset()          -> vt->reset(dev)                         **
**   NDDevice::Tick()           -> vt->tick(dev)   (same interruptBits)   **
**   NDDevice::Read(addr)       -> vt->read(dev, addr)                    **
**   NDDevice::Write(addr,val)  -> vt->write(dev, addr, val)              **
**   NDDevice::IDENT(level)     -> vt->ident(dev, level)                  **
**   NDDevice::IsInAddress()    -> start/endAddress copied from the core  **
**                                                                       **
** COMPILED ONLY under -DND120_DEVICECORE (runSim: make DEVICECORE=1).    **
** The default harness build never sees this file.                        **
**                                                                       **
** NDDeviceCore's headers are extern "C"-guarded, so the C99 cores link   **
** into this C++ harness unchanged.                                        **
