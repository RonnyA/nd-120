# ND-120 on Digilent Cmod A7-35T (future target)

**Full path:** `Verilog/fpga/cmod-a7-35t/`

## Status

**ACTIVE since 13-JUL-2026 - the owner has the board.** First-version build
files are in this directory (BRAM main memory, CPU at 27 MHz = the Tang
Nano 20K's full CPU speed; see "First build" below). The 512 KB SRAM
main-memory upgrade is specified in
[`SRAM-BRIDGE-PLAN.md`](SRAM-BRIDGE-PLAN.md) (pack16, <= 33 MHz validated -
see `Verilog/docs/basys3-memory-speed-validation.md`).
Board docs live with the board, not in `Verilog/docs/`.

## First build: ND-120 CPU on BRAM at 27 MHz

Same configuration as the Basys3 build (FPGA_FF_MODE, MAIN_RAM_BLOCKRAM,
runtime WCS load from the PROM images) but self-contained (no Vivado GUI
project) and clocked at 27 MHz:

```
cd Verilog/fpga/cmod-a7-35t
vivado -mode batch -source build.tcl                  # build + JTAG program
vivado -mode batch -source build.tcl -tclargs -noburn # build only
```
(or `make` / `make build` from WSL - Vivado path in the Makefile.)

- **Clocking - how 27 MHz comes from the 12 MHz crystal:** the
  `TARGET_CMOD_A7` branch in
  `Verilog/ND120_TOP.v` sets the MMCM to
  VCO = 12 x 63 = 756 MHz (inside the 600-1200 MHz range), clk_cpu =
  756 / 28 = **27.000 MHz exactly** - so `BOARD_CLK_FREQ=27000000` and
  every UART/RTC count matches the Tang. (A PLL cannot be used - its
  minimum input is 19 MHz; the MMCM goes down to 10 MHz.) If 27 MHz does
  not close timing, build.tcl fails loudly on negative WNS; fallback is
  `-verilog_define ND120_CMOD_MMCM_DIV=56.0` = 13.5 MHz (halved, still
  faster than nothing - and change BOARD_CLK_FREQ to 13500000 to match).
- Console: FT2232 COM port, **115200 8N1** (same as the Basys3 build).
- Buttons: BTN0 = reset. LEDs: LD0 = error/halt, LD1 = running; RGB
  (50% PWM per the manual's brightness warning): red = not-running,
  green = reset released, blue = UART TX.
- Main memory: BRAM, Basys3-equivalent default (3 banks x 4K words =
  24 KB). Raising it toward the 32-64K-word ceiling = `BANK_ADDR_BITS`
  in `MEM_RAM_49_BLOCKRAM.v` (+ `SKIP_WCS_LOAD` for the top of the range) -
  see the capacity math in
  `Verilog/docs/basys3-memory-speed-validation.md`
  section 4.1.

## SD-card Pmod on the single Pmod connector (JA)

The Digilent SD Pmods (Pmod MicroSD / Pmod SD - same mapping) plug
straight into JA. Wiring (Pmod pin -> JA pin -> FPGA pin, from
`Cmod-A7-Master.xdc`):

| Pmod pin | Signal | FPGA pin |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | ~CS / DAT3 | G17 |
| 2 | MOSI / CMD | G19 |
| 3 | MISO / DAT0 | N18 |
| 4 | SCK | L18 |
| 5, 11 | GND | - |
| 6, 12 | VCC = **3.3 V from the Pmod header** | - |
| 7 | DAT1 | H17 |
| 8 | DAT2 | H19 |
| 9 | CD (card detect) | J19 (optional, unused by the stack) |
| 10 | (WP / NC) | K18 (unused) |

**Voltage rules (do not skip):**

- The Pmod header's VCC pins supply **3.3 V** - correct for SD cards and
  both Digilent SD Pmods. Power the module ONLY from the Pmod header.
- **Never power the SD module from VU (DIP pin 24)** - VU is driven to
  ~5 V when USB is attached. SD cards are 3.3 V devices and the Cmod's
  FPGA pins are NOT 5 V tolerant.
- Note the reference-manual figure: VU's minimum rises with Pmod 3V3
  load (3.38 V @ 100 mA, 3.48 V @ 250 mA drawn from the Pmod header) -
  an SD card's ~100 mA is within budget on USB power.
- In the XDC, enable internal pull-ups on CMD/DAT0-3 (`PULLUP true`) -
  the stack needs released lines idling high (DAT3 high at CMD0 keeps
  the card out of SPI mode); the Pmod module's own pull-ups are not
  guaranteed. Same reasoning as the Basys3 port
  (`Verilog/fpga/basys3/sd-fat-test/`),
  which is also the wrapper template for a Cmod SD test build (swap the
  MMCM input for 12 MHz, pins from the table above).

## TODO: 512 KB SRAM main memory (pack16 bridge)

Full detailed plan: [`SRAM-BRIDGE-PLAN.md`](SRAM-BRIDGE-PLAN.md) - the
sheet-49 backend design (`MAIN_RAM_SRAM`), cycle-by-cycle timing at
27 MHz, the mandatory pack16 shape (the recorded 4-byte-access idea is
invalidated at any frequency), testbench and acceptance gates. Estimated
2-4 days. Upgrades main memory from ~24 KB BRAM to **256K words (512 KB)**
and frees BRAM.

Original research capture below (kept for reference):

**Historical note (superseded 13-JUL-2026):** this board was originally
downgraded to research-only vs the Tang Nano 20K on price/function; the
owner has since acquired one, so the port is live.

## Why this board

Same `xc7a35t-1cpg236` die **and package** as the Basys3 - bitstream-level
identical logic - but in a breadboardable DIP module with **512 KB external
SRAM**, which offers a third main-memory backend besides Basys3 BRAM and
Tang/QMTECH SDRAM.

## Pin source of truth

[`Cmod-A7-Master.xdc`](Cmod-A7-Master.xdc) - Digilent's official master XDC
(rev. B board), fetched 2026-07-08 from
<https://github.com/Digilent/digilent-xdc>. Every subsystem is in it:
clock `L17`, LEDs `A17`/`C16`, RGB LED `C17`(r)/`B16`(g)/`B17`(b), buttons
`A18`/`B18`, Pmod JA (8 signals), UART `J17`/`J18` (matches the reference
manual), QSPI, the full SRAM map, the 44 DIP GPIOs (`pio1`-`pio48`, with
gaps: DIP 15/16 usable instead as XADC analog inputs `vaux4`/`vaux12`,
DIP 24/25 = VU/GND power), and a 1-wire pin (`D17`) for the onboard crypto
authentication chip. Uncomment + rename lines from there; don't re-derive.

## Board facts (verify against the reference manual at bring-up)

- FPGA: XC7A35T-1CPG236C - 20,800 LUT, 225 KB BRAM (same part as Basys3, so
  the Basys3 Vivado flow and fixes apply unchanged).
- 12 MHz system clock on pin **`L17`** (an MRCC input on bank 14). Must be
  multiplied by an **MMCM** - a PLL cannot be used directly (PLL minimum
  input is 19 MHz, per the reference manual). Note the Basys3-derived
  clocking needs new math here: 12 MHz in vs the Basys3's 100 MHz and the
  QMTECH's 50 MHz (e.g. 16.667 MHz clk_cpu = 12 x 50 / 36, VCO 600 MHz -
  recompute properly at bring-up against the 7-series MMCM VCO range).
- 512 KB external async SRAM: ISSI **`IS61WV5128BLL-10BLI`** - 19 address +
  8 bi-directional data + 3 control signals, **8 ns access** at the board's
  3.3 V +/-5% supply (theoretical max 125 MB/s). Datasheet (A/B variants):
  <https://www.issi.com/WW/pdf/61-64WV5128Axx-Bxx.pdf>. Full FPGA<->SRAM pin
  map is in the local [`Cmod-A7-Master.xdc`](Cmod-A7-Master.xdc)
  ("Cellular RAM" section: `MemAdr[18:0]`, `MemDB[7:0]`, `RamOEn`/`RamWEn`/`RamCEn`).
- 4 MB QSPI config flash (`mx25l3273f`), Master-SPI boot at power-on.
  Programmed indirectly from the Vivado hardware manager (needs Vivado
  >= 2017.2); supports x1/x2/x4 bus widths, up to 50 MHz config rate.
  Flash write takes 4-5 min (erase-dominated); subsequent power-on config
  is <1 s. Same volatile-vs-flash split as our other boards: JTAG `.bit`
  for iteration, flash `.mcs` for standalone boot.
- **Configuration behavior:** power-on always tries the QSPI flash first; no
  valid flash image -> FPGA sits unconfigured until JTAG-programmed. JTAG
  programming works any time power is on and overwrites the running config.
  Uncompressed bitstream is ~17.5 Mbit and takes ~6 s over the onboard
  USB-JTAG; enabling bitstream compression in Vivado (up to ~10x depending
  on design fill) cuts both JTAG time and flash-erase footprint. "DONE" LED
  lights on successful configuration.
- USB-JTAG **and** USB-UART via the onboard FTDI **FT2232HQ** on the micro
  USB connector (like the Basys3, unlike the QMTECH board) - power,
  programming, ILA/VIO and the OPCOM console all over one cable. The two
  functions are fully independent (UART traffic never interferes with JTAG
  and vice versa). UART lands on FPGA pins **`J17`/`J18`** (TXD/RXD); the
  status LED next to DIP pin 25 blinks on TX/RX traffic. Standard FTDI VCP
  drivers -> plain COM port on the host.
- **Power:** either micro USB (4.5-5.5 V) or an external supply on DIP pins
  24/25 (`VU`/GND, 3.32-5.5 V; the VU minimum rises with Pmod 3V3 load:
  3.38 V @ 100 mA, 3.48 V @ 250 mA drawn from the Pmod header). When USB is
  attached, VU is *driven* to ~5 V through a schottky diode (usable to power
  external circuitry).
- **Warning (from the reference manual):** because VU is driven when a USB
  host is attached, disconnect any external supply on DIP pin 24 (especially
  a battery) before plugging in USB - or add a series schottky diode on VU
  if both sources must coexist (see Digilent forum guidance).
- 2 user LEDs + 1 tri-color (RGB) LED, 2 push buttons, one Pmod connector,
  44 DIP-pin user I/Os.
- **Tri-color LED is active-low** (anodes on 3V3, cathodes on FPGA pins -
  drive 0 to light, same polarity as the QMTECH LEDs). Reference manual
  warning: never drive a color with a steady `1`-equivalent (steady low) -
  it is uncomfortably bright; use PWM at <=50% duty cycle per color (which
  also gives a full mixed-color palette).
- **XADC:** 1 MSPS on-chip ADC; DIP pins 15/16 are 0-3.3 V analog inputs
  (`vaux4`/`vaux12`, see the master XDC). Not needed for the ND-120, but free.
- Variants: A7-**35T** (ours: 20,800 LUT / 41,800 FF / 225 KB BRAM) and
  A7-15T (10,400 LUT / 112.5 KB BRAM - **retired**, no longer sold). Board is
  0.7 in x 2.75 in, fits a standard 48-pin DIP socket.

## Plan (from `Verilog/TODO.md`, to be expanded here)

1. **Backend phase 1 - BRAM:** start with `MAIN_RAM_BLOCKRAM` (raise
   `BANK_ADDR_BITS`; 225 KB BRAM minus the WCS budget). Gets the board booting
   with the least new code.
2. **Backend phase 2 - external SRAM:** a `MEM_RAM_49_SRAM` backend for the
   512 KB SRAM. 8-bit bus means ~4 byte-accesses per 18-bit ND word (2 data
   bytes + parity) - needs its own protocol bridge like the Tang SDRAM one
   (`../tang-nano-20k/sdram-bridge/`), validated testbench-first against the
   measured ND-120 DRAM protocol (`../../docs/nd120-dram-memory.md` section 6).
3. **SD-card block device:** SD-card Pmod on the Pmod connector - shares the
   SPI-mode SD + FAT reader core planned for Basys3 (see `Verilog/TODO.md`,
   "SD-card block devices across all boards").

Prerequisite, as for every board: the board-independent clock-enable /
FF-mode work must boot first (see [`../README.md`](../README.md), "Shared
context").
