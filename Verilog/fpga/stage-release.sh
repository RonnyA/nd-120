#!/usr/bin/env bash
# stage-release.sh - copy a board's build output into fpga/release-staging/ under
# the canonical release name (board_clock_baud), then regenerate SHA256SUMS.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Every board's build tool emits a generic name
# (nd120_nexys4ddr.bit, nd120_mega65_r6.cor, ...). The download name that carries
# the clock and baud is a RELEASE convention, and it used to be applied by hand -
# which once shipped a MEGA65 .cor named for a build it was not. The canonical
# names live in release-manifest.txt; this script stages by name from there, so
# the convention is declared once and never retyped.
#
# Usage:
#   ./stage-release.sh <release-name> [<release-name> ...]   stage those artifacts + refresh SHA256SUMS
#   ./stage-release.sh --sums                                just regenerate SHA256SUMS
#   ./stage-release.sh --list                                print the manifest (the valid names)
#
# The console is 115200 7E1 on every board.
