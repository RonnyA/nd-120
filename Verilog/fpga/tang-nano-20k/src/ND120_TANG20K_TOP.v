  // 72 accesses END TO END for a whole LIST-FILE-NAMES, and the trigger - a
  // read of +0 - first fires at access 17, so a 64-deep ring holds every
  // access from power-on up to and including the first failing transfer.
  //
  // 10-AUG-2026: 64 was NOT enough for the '20500&' mass load. That sequence
  // is hundreds of accesses long, so a 64-deep ring wrapped and returned only
  // its tail - every transfer in it completed with status 060010 and a
  // correctly advanced memory address register, which says nothing about
  // where the guest decided the load had failed. 256 buys the whole window,

  // calls at 064544/064545 that the oracle takes (to 004600 and 052031, 170
  // instructions). A story that FITS is that the decode lost instruction bit
  // 11, which is the only bit separating JPL (134000-137000) from the
  // conditional jumps (130000-133000): 135111 would become 131111, JAZ 111,
  // and with A = 144017 that does not jump - it falls through, exactly as
  // observed, on both instructions.
  //
  // That is a GUESS and it has a hole: SINTRAN executes JPL constantly for the
  // 150 seconds before this point, so bit 11 cannot be generally lost. This
  // probe replaces the guess with a measurement - it records the microcode
  // address the decode actually dispatched to.

  // the page-table index has its TOP TWO BITS COMPLEMENTED in hardware and the

  // multiplexes level 1 among programs from the scheduler at PIL-2 032037, and

  // Two ways in, because the two failures look different from here:
  //   - a COMPLETED operation then ~1 s of quiet: the DISC-TEMA case, where
  //     the memory-address readback is the last thing to happen;
  //   - at least 4 accesses then ~4 s of quiet with nothing completing: the
  //     mass-load hang. The count requirement stops a lone probe during the
  //     floppy boot from tripping it, which is what made an earlier version
  //     fire early and dump an empty ring.
  // The idle threshold has to exceed the LONGEST gap DISC-TEMA leaves while
  // collecting Disc name / Unit / Cylinder / Surface / Sector / Amount from
  // the operator. Measured: about 15 s with the scripted driver, longer with
  // a human. A 4 s window fired at the "Amount" prompt and dumped only the
  // seven opening probe accesses. 30 s clears it; the mass-load hang is
  // permanent, so any threshold works there.
  //
  // The completion path stays at ~1 s and fires FIRST in every healthy run,
  // so this long window only ever matters when nothing completes at all.
  // 09-AUG-2026: BOTH terms now also require a MINIMUM ACCESS COUNT, because
  // the old thresholds fired during the boot probe and dumped an empty ring -
  // exactly the failure this comment block warned about, just at a different
  // scale. Loading the File System Investigator from tape and getting it to
  // its first Winchester read takes well over the 30 s idle window, so a
  // 2-access boot probe armed the capture long before the traffic of
  // interest existed. The captured File System Investigator sequence
  // (nd100x, ND100X_WD_DEBUG=1) reaches its first completed transfer at
  // access 12 and runs to 72, so 8 and 40 sit clear of a probe and well
  // inside the real run.
  // THRESHOLDS MEASURED, NOT GUESSED. 09-AUG-2026 on silicon: a complete
  // File System Investigator session - load from tape, open DISC-74MB-1
  // unit 0, read the geometry, then LI-FI - produces only FOUR accesses of
  // this card's own (status read, the M7 return-to-zero, the completion
  // interrupt, status read). With the old >=8 requirement the trigger could
  // therefore NEVER fire, and a 180 s idle capture came back with no dump
  // at all - which reads exactly like "the probe is broken" and is why the
  // numbers are now tied to a measurement instead of a guess.
  //
  // The counts exist only to stop a ONE-access probe from arming, so 3 is
  // enough. The second term (no completion at all) drops in proportion.
  // 09-AUG-2026, SECOND correction, measured not guessed: the completion-path
  // idle window was 13_500_000 = ONE SECOND at 13.5 MHz, and that makes an
  // interactive File System Investigator session impossible to capture. The
  // console floor is 0.30 s per character (below 0.20 s OPCOM drops input), so
  // typing "LI-FI" alone takes 1.5 s, and the operator gap between answering
  // "Device unit :" and issuing the command is several seconds more. None of
  // that touches the Winchester, so wd_idle runs free and the capture closes
  // during the DIALOGUE - long before the read it exists to record. Observed
  // exactly that: the ring dumped while LI-FI was still printing, holding only
  // the three opening probe accesses. 45 s clears any scripted dialogue gap
  // and still fires well inside a listen window. Both terms move together so
