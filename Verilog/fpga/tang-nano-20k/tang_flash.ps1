# ND120 Tang Nano 20K - program the board (Windows PowerShell)
#
#   cd E:\Dev\Repos\Ronny\nd-120\Verilog\fpga\tang-nano-20k
#   .\tang_flash.ps1              # permanent write into the board's flash
#   .\tang_flash.ps1 -Sram        # volatile SRAM load (gone on power-off)
#   .\tang_flash.ps1 -Build       # run gowin_build.ps1 first, then flash
#   .\tang_flash.ps1 -Force       # flash even if the staleness check complains
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   Programming needs openFPGALoader, which needs raw USB access to the Tang's
#   FTDI. That lives on the WSL side, and WSL only sees the FTDI after usbipd
#   hands it over. This script does the whole chain from Windows: check the
#   bitstream is real and current, attach the board (tang_usb.ps1), then run
#   openFPGALoader through WSL.
#
# THE STALENESS CHECK
#   The failure that motivated this: a .fs left over from an older build sits
#   in build\ and flashes perfectly happily, so the board runs code that has
#   nothing to do with the sources you just edited. This script compares the
#   bitstream's timestamp against the newest .v in the Verilog tree and the
#   project file list, and refuses (unless -Force) when the bitstream is older.
#   It also prints which optional controllers tang20k_defines.v currently
#   selects, so what you are about to flash is stated out loud.
