// Fmax = 38.65 MHz with the 24 KB memory and 36.91 MHz once main memory grew
// to 192 KB, against a 40 MHz requirement - setup slack -0.870 ns, TNS
// -111.6 ns. A CPU that misses setup latches wrong values, which on silicon
// looks exactly like "it does not run", while the shallow console and panel
// logic keeps working - the symptom this board actually showed.
//
// 20 MHz is an exact divide of the existing PLL output, so it needs no
// second PLL, and it leaves ~2x margin (50 ns period against the ~27 ns the
// longest path needs). It is also the speed the Tang is timing-clean at, so
// it is not an unreasonable number for this design on this class of fabric.
//
// The video side stays at 40 MHz - 800x600@60 needs exactly that - and the
// only link between the two domains is the console SERIAL line, which is
// asynchronous by nature. That is the same split nd120_nexys4ddr_top.v uses
// (console UART on the pixel clock, CPU on its own clock).
//
// nd120.qsf's BOARD_CLK_FREQ MUST equal this: SC2661_UART.v derives the

// - "Not implemented, we use constant ... 8N1"; HARDWARE.md, commit
// 773651f). NEVER 7E1 - a 7E1 deserializer against an 8N1 sender reads the
// 8th data bit as a parity bit and corrupts every odd-population character.
//
// Both run on clk_sys because CORE.clk_cpu IS clk_sys here (one clock domain
// for the whole build, see the note below) - the 2-flop synchronizer inside
// console_uart_rx is harmless and left in place rather than special-cased
// out, the same call nd120_console_mister already makes for its own CDC.
// 7 DATA BITS + PARITY, like the Nexys - NOT 8N1 (02-SEP-2026, measured).
// The CPU's SC2661 frames 8 bits, but what SINTRAN puts in bit 7 during its
// boot text is SOFTWARE PARITY: a raw capture of the serial line on the HPS
// (/dev/ttyS1) during the first SINTRAN boot on this board shows CR as 8D,
// space as A0, '4' as B4 - every character with an odd number of ones has
// bit 7 set - while later output is plain 7-bit. The terminal controller
// drops any byte >= 7F, so with an 8N1 receiver every other character of
// those lines vanished ("SNAN-VS500M" for "SINTRAN III - VSX/500 M") and
// so did every CR (the staircase). A 7E1 receiver treats bit 7 as the
// parity bit and discards it, which is what the real TDV2200 did on a real
// 7E1 line and what fpga/nexys4ddr does (ND120_CONSOLE_DATA_BITS 7,
// ND120_CONSOLE_PARITY 1). Gate: sim/console_burst_tb.v sends the

//
// DO NOT put a [ND120] uartmode= section in /media/fat/MiSTer.ini for this.

	// MAIN_RAM_SDRAM + ND_SDRAM_PACK16 + ND_SDRAM_DQ16 (nd120.qsf): the
	// Tang's proven sheet-49 bridge (fpga/tang-nano-20k/sdram-bridge/
	// MEM_RAM_49_SDRAM.v + sdram18.v) in its 16-bit-module mode. 2M words =
	// 4 MB as BANK0 + BANK2, the same map as the Tang and the Nexys; parity
	// regenerated on read. The bridge runs on clk2x from the CPU's own PLL
	// (edge-aligned, see pll_cpu.v) and meets the ND-120 DRAM read deadline
	// (data at OSC N+4) exactly as on the Tang. This replaces the block-RAM
	// main memory, whose 32K-word banks wrapped every address >= 0o100000
	// (the LIST-FILE-NAMES runaway, build v48) and whose 64K-word variant
	// did not fit the device (v49). The WCS is untouched: it stays in block
	// RAM exactly as before.
	// The module is 16 bits wide with two DQM pins and 13 address lines; the
	// bridge's ports are the Tang's 32-bit shape, so the upper 16 DQ bits and
	// upper 2 DQM bits are simply left unconnected and A[12:11] are 0.
