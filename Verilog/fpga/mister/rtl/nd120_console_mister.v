//============================================================================
//! MiSTer glue for the board-independent terminal core.
//!
//! Full path: Verilog/fpga/mister/rtl/nd120_console_mister.v
//!
//! Everything MiSTer-specific about the console lives here, and nothing
//! MiSTer-specific lives in Verilog/Terminals/. The terminal core is shared
//! with the Nexys 4 DDR and (later) the MEGA65; the only things that differ
//! per board are the two ends - where keystrokes come from and where pixels
//! go - which is exactly what this file is.
//!
//! THE KEYBOARD END. hps_io gives us `ps2_key = {toggle, pressed, extended,
//! code[7:0]}` (sys/hps_io.sv:102-103, 306) - Linux has already done the USB
//! work AND the PS/2 framing, so there is no serial line to decode. That is
//! why this instantiates `ps2_decoder` and NOT `ps2_keyboard`: the framing
//! half of the Nexys keyboard has no job here, while the half with the actual
//! logic in it - modifiers, caps lock, control characters, the TDV cursor
//! keys - is shared. Bit 10 toggles per event rather than pulsing, so it needs
//! an edge detector to become a strobe.
//!
//! THE VIDEO END. MiSTer wants CLK_VIDEO + CE_PIXEL + VGA_DE/HS/VS/R/G/B and
//! scales whatever it is given. We hand it the terminal's own 800x600@60
//! timing at one pixel per clock, so CE_PIXEL is simply 1 - the same video
//! mode the Nexys build uses, which means one tested configuration rather than
//! one per board.
//!
//! BUILD 1 (28-AUG-2026) has no ND-120 in it at all. `cpu_*` is wired but
//! nothing drives it, so what you get is the banner plus local echo: type and
//! the characters appear. That is the whole point of build 1 - it proves the
//! clock, the video timing, the font, the character RAM and the keyboard on
//! real MiSTer hardware with NOTHING of the CPU able to be blamed. Build 2
//! drops ND3202D in behind the same seam.
//!
//! Written 28-AUG-2026.

// TDV2200 (the shared core's default, undefined) - matching the Nexys and
// what SINTRAN drives both boards as. This file USED to `define
// ND120_TERMINAL_VT100 because its keyboard end only wired ps2_decoder +
// key_vt100 and "there is no TDV keyboard path here yet". That path is wired
// now (02-SEP-2026): ps2_decoder_tdv + the key_tdv2200 marker expander below,
// exactly as nd120_nexys4ddr_top.v does. Display and keyboard now speak the
// same terminal type - TDV2200 - so the box glyphs (font page 2) and the TDV
// cursor/function keys work here as they do on the Nexys. Do NOT re-add the
// VT100 `define without also switching the keyboard back, or the two ends
