//! Dedicated CPU clock PLL - 50 MHz in, 20 MHz out.
//!
//! Full path: Verilog/fpga/mister/rtl/pll_cpu.v
//!
//! WHY THIS EXISTS (31-AUG-2026). The CPU clock used to be made in fabric:
//!
//!     reg clk_cpu_div = 1'b0;
//!     always @(posedge clk_sys) clk_cpu_div <= ~clk_cpu_div;
//!
//! That works perfectly in simulation and is WRONG on silicon. Quartus put
//! `emu:emu|clk_cpu_div` in the fitter's "Non-Global High Fan-Out Signals"
//! report - i.e. the clock for the ENTIRE CPU was distributed on ordinary
//! routing rather than a global clock network, so its edge arrived at
//! thousands of registers at wildly different times. The board's console,
//! panel and uptime all kept working because they run on the 40 MHz PLL
//! output, which IS global (CLKCTRL_G7); only the CPU misbehaved. That is
//! exactly the "boots in the simulator, does nothing on the board" symptom
//! this port spent a day chasing.
//!
//! TimeQuest did not catch it: it analysed the routing it was handed, met
//! the 50 ns period and reported Fmax 28.9 MHz. Meeting timing on a badly
//! distributed clock is not the same as the clock being sound.
//!
//! A PLL OUTPUT is placed on a global clock network by construction, which
//! is what every other board does - the Nexys takes clk_cpu from an MMCM
//! output, the Tang from an rPLL output. Neither divides in fabric.
//!
//! Instantiated straight from altera_pll with explicit parameters rather
//! than generated through the Quartus GUI (the same approach used for the
//! altsyncram RAMs here) - only the frequency strings differ from
//! rtl/pll/pll_0002.v, which altera_pll turns into counter settings at
//! synthesis.
