** nd_storage_hps - the ND-120 storage client bus served by the MiSTer HPS  **
**                                                                         **
** WHAT THIS IS                                                            **
**                                                                         **
** The MiSTer replacement for nd_storage (Verilog/SD-FAT/circuit/          **
** nd_storage.v). It presents the SAME flattened client port - spec         **
** Verilog/docs/nd-storage-interface-spec.md section 4: one request moves  **
** ONE 2048-byte block (1024 ND words) by file-relative 16-bit block       **
** number, and the backend masters the client's own buffer through         **
** buf_addr / buf_wdata / buf_we (reads) and buf_rdata (writes) - so the   **
** controller-facing adapters (nd_storage_floppy_adapter,                  **
** nd_storage_disc_adapter, nd_storage_tape_adapter) are reused unchanged. **
** On the other side there is no SD card, no SPI, no FAT: the images are   **
** FILES the user mounts from the MiSTer OSD, and the HPS (the ARM side)   **
** serves them through hps_io's block interface. One client = one OSD      **
** mount slot ("S<n>" line in CONF_STR) = one file.                        **
**                                                                         **
** THE HPS BLOCK INTERFACE, AS IT REALLY BEHAVES (read from the official   **
** docs, Main_MiSTer/user_io.cpp and sys/hps_io.sv on 01-SEP-2026; the     **
** rules below are what the design is built on, not guesses):             **
**   - The ARM POLLS. It never sees sd_rd change; it reads a status word,  **
**     picks ONE slot with a request pending (rotating round-robin),       **
**     samples that slot's sd_lba in the same transaction, and later runs  **
**     ONE data transaction with sd_ack[slot] high for its whole length.   **
**     So: hold sd_rd/sd_wr until sd_ack RISES, then drop it (the official **
**     sys/sd_card.sv does exactly this); the FALLING edge of sd_ack means **
**     "block done". sd_lba and sd_blk_cnt must be stable from request to  **
**     ack.                                                                **
**   - sd_blk_cnt = 3 with BLKSZ = 2 (512-byte blocks) makes one 2048-byte **
**     transaction, one ack, sd_buff_addr running 0..1023 words in WIDE    **
**     (16-bit) mode. Exactly one client block.                            **
**   - Data arrives at the HPS SPI rate, many clk_sys cycles per word:     **
**     sd_buff_wr pulses one cycle per word, sd_buff_addr increments two   **
**     cycles after it. For WRITES the core must present sd_buff_din =     **
**     buffer[sd_buff_addr] from address 0 the moment ack rises; the ARM   **
**     reads it on its own strobe and bumps the address.                   **
**   - The buffer bus (sd_buff_addr/dout/wr) is BROADCAST to every slot.   **
**     This module only ever has ONE transaction in flight, so it        **
**     qualifies by "the slot I asked for" rather than by a per-slot ack.  **
**   - A read on an UNMOUNTED slot is still acked and returns zeros. The   **
**     only way to know there is no image is the mount pulse: img_mounted  **
**     [n] pulses a few cycles, img_size / img_readonly are valid during   **
**     it (the size is sent first), and an UNMOUNT is the same pulse with  **
**     img_size == 0. So a request on an unmounted slot never reaches the  **
**     HPS here: it completes at once with err + NDS_ERR_NOTOPEN, per the  **
**     rule in nd_storage_status.vh (never done-without-error on a fault,  **
**     never done-never).                                                  **
**   - Writes go to the file immediately (O_SYNC on the ARM). A write past **
**     the end of the file is trimmed and the image cannot grow, so a      **
**     write whose block does not lie entirely inside the file is refused  **
**     here with NDS_ERR_RANGE. Read-only is only REPORTED by the HPS      **
**     (img_readonly); enforcing it is our job: NDS_ERR_WRPROT.            **
**                                                                         **
** CLOCKS. The client port is the CPU domain (clk_cpu, 20 MHz on this      **
** board); hps_io is clk_sys (40 MHz, and it must be >= 20 MHz per the     **
** MiSTer maintainer). They are two PLL outputs and are treated as         **
** asynchronous. Each block goes through a staging buffer of this module's **
** own - rbuf for reads (written on clk_sys by the HPS stream, read on     **
** clk_cpu into the client), wbuf for writes (filled on clk_cpu from the   **
** client, read on clk_sys by the HPS) - and one 4-phase go/done handshake **
** carries the request across. Two simple-dual-port 1024x16 RAMs rather   **
** than one true-dual-port RAM: one write port each is what every tool     **
** infers without argument. The mount records cross the other way on a    **
** per-slot toggle: the clk_sys side latches mounted/size/readonly on the  **
** img_mounted pulse and flips the toggle; the clk_cpu side copies the     **
** (long since stable) record when it sees the toggle change.              **
**                                                                         **
** BYTE ORDER. ND image words are big-endian bytes: word w = {byte 2w,     **
** byte 2w+1} (nd_storage_disc_adapter.v, and the nd_storage engine packs  **
** them that way, so one image file works in Verilator, on the Tang/Nexys  **
** card and here). hps_io in WIDE mode hands over the file as 16-bit       **
** little-endian words, {byte 2w+1, byte 2w}. BYTE_SWAP = 1 swaps once in  **
** each direction. It is a parameter because the HPS word order is taken   **
** from reading the framework, not from a measurement on this board; the   **
** Phase-4 byte-order check on real hardware is the proof, and if it says  **
** otherwise this is the one line to flip.                                 **
**                                                                         **
** Port shapes: everything per-slot is FLATTENED (slot n in bits           **
** [n*W +: W]) because this is plain Verilog; nd120.sv unpacks into the    **
** SystemVerilog arrays hps_io wants. sd_buff_din is ONE value: only one   **
** transaction is ever in flight, so every hps_io slot can be fed the same **
** word.                                                                   **
