 *  nd120_sterr_catch.v - catch the self-test failure and report its number    *
 *                                                                            *
 *  WHY (01-SEP-2026, Ronny's call)                                            *
 *  -------------------------------                                            *
 *  The MiSTer board reaches no OPCOM prompt. Sampling the microcode address   *
 *  once a second was a dead end - it ALIASES against a tight loop and reports *
 *  arbitrary points inside it. The direct question is instead: did the        *
 *  microcode take the self-test failure branch, and if so with what error?    *
 *                                                                            *
 *  The DELILAH microcode answers it at address 002156:                        *
 *                                                                            *
 *      % DISPLAY ERROR NO. R2                                                 *
 *      STERR:  B,R2   ALUF,PASSB  ALUD,Q                                      *
 *              IDBS,ALU           T,JMP  T,PUSH DYTP2;                        *
 *              ALUF,PASSQ ALUD,NONE  % LOOP ON ERROR                          *
 *              IDBS,ALU   COMM,LDPIL  T,RETURN T,HOLD;                        *
 *                                                                            *
 *  So STERR selects R2 onto the register file's B port. This module watches   *
 *  for CSA == 002156 and latches that port. The value it captures IS R2, by   *
 *  construction - no need to know which of the sixteen register slots the     *
 *  microcode assembler's name "R2" decodes to. The captured LBA field reports *
 *  that slot as a by-product, which settles the question for good.            *
 *                                                                            *
 *  CAREFUL - not every visit counts. The WCS loader walks PAST the STERR      *
 *  address once while loading microcode (noted in CLAUDE.md); only            *
 *  execution-phase visits mean a real self-test failure. This module          *
 *  therefore reports a COUNT as well as the value, and keeps BOTH the first   *
 *  and the most recent capture, so a single spurious walk-past is visible as  *
 *  count==1 rather than being mistaken for a failure.                         *
 *                                                                            *
 *  DIAGNOSTIC SCAFFOLDING, built only under ND120_DIAG_PRINT.                 *
