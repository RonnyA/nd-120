# Program an ALREADY-BUILT bitstream onto the Nexys 4 DDR over JTAG.

#   vivado -mode batch -source program.tcl
#   vivado -mode batch -source program.tcl -tclargs <path-to-.bit>
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS SEPARATELY from build.tcl. build.tcl programs the board at the
# end unless given -noburn, which means "just flash what I already built" would
# otherwise cost a full re-synthesis - about ten minutes to repeat work that is
# already sitting on disk. This does only the programming, in seconds.
#
# VOLATILE. This writes the FPGA's configuration RAM over JTAG; it does not
# touch the QSPI flash. A power cycle restores whatever was flashed before, so
# the worst case of a bad bitstream is "power the board off and on again".
#
# The board must be visible to Windows, not attached to WSL - usbipd hands the
# FTDI device to one or the other, and Vivado cannot see it while WSL holds it.
# Run ./usb-attach.sh --detach first if the console has been in use from Linux.
