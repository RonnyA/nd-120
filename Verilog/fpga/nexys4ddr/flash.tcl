# The volatile counterpart is program.tcl (JTAG into configuration RAM,

#
# FLASH PART: the Nexys 4 DDR carries a Spansion S25FL128S (128 Mbit, QSPI).
# The exact Vivado cfgmem part NAME varies between Vivado releases, so instead
# of hard-coding one this script asks the running Vivado for every cfgmem part
# matching s25fl128 and uses the first SPIx4 one - and prints what it picked,
# so a wrong pick is visible in the log rather than silent.
#
# After flashing, the FPGA is booted from the new image (boot_hw_device), so
# the board is running it immediately - no power cycle needed to check.
#
# The board must be attached to Windows, not WSL (usbipd) - same rule as
# program.tcl.
