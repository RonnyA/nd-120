# drives F:/Xilinx/ND120/ND3202D). Everything here is in-memory and lives in

# CPU clock selection
#  The board oscillator is 100 MHz; the MMCM in ND120_TOP.v (branch
#  TARGET_NEXYS4DDR) runs VCO = 100 x 10 = 1000 MHz and divides it down.
#  clk=<MHz> picks the divider AND the matching BOARD_CLK_FREQ - the two
#  MUST move together or every derived count (UART baud, RTC tick,
#  watchdogs) is wrong.
#
#  STALE MEASUREMENT KEPT FOR HISTORY (superseded): 20-AUG-2026 builds
#  measured WNS -35.107 ns at 16.667 MHz. After the 22-AUG FIDBO ring cut
#  (commit b3ee391) the SAME configuration closes with WNS ~+1.4 ns at
#  16.667 MHz (verified across every 23/24-AUG build). The bucket analysis
#  below describes the PRE-CUT worst path:
#  The worst path ran from an interrupt mask bit
#  (INTR/CNTLR/IRQ_MASK/MASKBIT10) to the WCS BRAM address input over 181
#  logic levels / 94.4 ns, with NO register in between. Measured Fmax of the
#  CPU domain is therefore about 10.5 MHz, so clk=8 is the first entry that
#  can pass the gate and clk=10 is marginal.
#
#  Where the 94.4 ns goes, bucketed from timing.rpt:
#      CGA/ALU  (OUTMUX/RALU/STS)   58.8 ns   62%
#      CGA/MAC                      14.5 ns   15%
#      CGA/INTR                      8.2 ns    9%
#      MMU cache                     4.3 ns    5%
#  It is an ALU path, not an interrupt path and not a device-chain path.
#
#  TWO THINGS THIS COMMENT USED TO CLAIM, BOTH WRONG, both corrected after
#  reading the Tang's own Gowin report
#  (fpga/tang-nano-20k/build/nd120_tang20k_build/impl/pnr/*.tr):
#    - "the same RTL closes 27 MHz on the Tang". It does not. The Tang's CPU
#      domain is constrained at 6.75 MHz and its actual Fmax is 5.08 MHz with
#      1532 violating endpoints. The 27 MHz figure belongs to sys_clk, the
#      crystal INPUT PORT, which is the only clock its six-line .sdc
#      constrains. In absolute nanoseconds this board is about twice as fast
#      as the Tang has ever run.
#    - "the device chain explains the path". It does not. The Tang carries
#      the identical tape + floppy + Winchester set (SMD off).
#
#  Every setting is an EXPERIMENT until its own timing report is clean, and
#  the WNS gate below refuses to write a bitstream that misses. The Gowin
#  flow has no such gate, which is why the Tang has been writing bitstreams
#  over 1532 violating endpoints.

# KNOWN COMBINATIONAL LOOPS - acknowledged deliberately, not hidden.
#
# Last verified 24-AUG-2026 (this block used to claim "12 loops remain" -
# that was pre-ring-cut and STALE; commit b3ee391 cut the FIDBO ring):
# the current builds report ZERO LUTLP-1 errors and Vivado auto-inserts
# exactly TWO loop-breaking false paths (Synth 8-326):
#   set_false_path -through .../CGA/DELILAH/ALU/ALU_OUTMUX/D_15_0[8]... 
#   set_false_path -through ALU_i_426/O
# Paths THROUGH those two nodes are untimed - the WNS gate below does not
# cover them. The historical ring was:
#   ALU_OUTMUX D_15_0[n] -> G_15_0[n] -> CGA.v FIDBO
#     -> MAC / INTR (CGA.v:614-615 feed FIDBO into their IDB inputs)
#     -> PCR / PGS / PICMASK -> CGA_IDBCTL_SEL6 -> back to FIDBO
# functionally impossible (one-hot CSIDBS_4_0), unprovable by the tool.
#
# EVIDENCE THAT THIS IS SAFE TO SHIP, not merely convenient:
#  - the SAME RTL with the SAME loops runs on the Tang Nano 20K and boots
#    SINTRAN. The Gowin flow has no loop DRC at all, so it has been producing
#    working bitstreams over them all along.
#  - instruction-verify against the ND-110 golden emulator passes with these
#    fixes in: "TRACES EQUIVALENT: 400 aligned instructions match exactly".
#
# WHAT THIS COSTS: Vivado's timing analysis through these paths is not
# trustworthy, so the WNS number below is a lower bound, not a guarantee.
# That is why the CPU clock stays conservative.
#
# THIS IS A PARKED DEBT, NOT A FIX. The real repair is to break the ring in
# RTL - see EXTENSIONS-PLAN.md and the 20-AUG analysis. Remove this block the
# day the loop count reaches zero, and let the DRC prove it.

# --- optional JTAG ILA on the floppy CB-fetch / FDISK seam (-tclargs ila) ---
# Captures, in the clk_cpu domain: the floppy controller's DMA client port
# (command-block fetch + data transfers) and the FDISK request/answer seam.
# Nothing in the sources changes; the core is inserted post-synth. Arm and
# read it with ila_capture.tcl.
# -tclargs ilaslim: MINIMAL probe set (RAM write port + CSA + cpu_txd only,
# depth 1024) so an ILA fits NEXT TO the addr16 main RAM (128/135 RAMB36).
# Purpose: trigger on the SINTRAN ERRFA register save (RAM write to 0o4347)
# and read the saved X,T,A,D,L words off the write port.

# --- -tclargs ilacache: the cache-write question, and nothing else ----------
#
# Added 28-AUG-2026. CACHE-1X0-A00 test 2 says the cache is inert in both
# directions - never written, therefore never hit. A cache write is
# PAL_44402D asserting WCA:
#
#   WCA = /RT * DT * EWC * CYD * /FMISS * /LSHADOW
#       + RT * /IHIT * EWC * CYD * /FMISS * /LSHADOW
#
# The PAL is transcribed correctly and CON is tied high, so one of WCINH_n,
# BRK_n, CYD, FMISS or LSHADOW is holding WCA off and the source cannot say
# which. s_ila_cache carries all six (see CPU_MMU_24.v's DBG_CACHE comment).
#
# This is its OWN flag rather than an addition to "ila" because that probe
# set is aimed at the floppy/IOX seam, is large, and currently references
# s_ila_ram_addr, which no longer exists in this configuration - so "ila"
# fails before it gets anywhere near the cache. Keeping the sets separate
# means the cache capture does not depend on that being tidied up first.
