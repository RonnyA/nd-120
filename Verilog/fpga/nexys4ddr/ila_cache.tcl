# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ILA session for the CACHE-WRITE question (build.tcl -tclargs ilacache).
#
# THE QUESTION. CACHE-1X0-A00 test 2, run on the board 28-AUG-2026, reports the
# cache inert in both directions and both halves, paged and unpaged: nothing is
# ever copied INTO it, nothing is ever taken FROM it, so CUP never sets. A
# cache write is PAL_44402D asserting WCA, and its PALASM says
#
#   WCA = /RT * DT * EWC * CYD * /FMISS * /LSHADOW      ; write outside shadow
#       + RT * /IHIT * EWC * CYD * /FMISS * /LSHADOW    ; fetch/read without hit
#
# Both terms need EWC and CYD high and FMISS and LSHADOW low. The PAL is
# transcribed correctly (checked against DesignDocuments/PAL-Code/SRC/44402D.txt)
# and CON is tied high in ND120_CORE.v, so the blocker is one of WCINH_n,
# BRK_n, CYD, FMISS, LSHADOW - and the source cannot say which. This measures it.
#
# s_ila_cache, from CPU_MMU_24's DBG_CACHE port:
#   [0] LSHADOW  [1] FMISS  [2] CYD  [3] BRK_n  [4] WCINH_n  [5] WCA_n
#
# MODES (pass ONE as -tclargs):
#   program   program the .bit + .ltx and leave the board running
#   armnow    free-running capture, triggers immediately. Use this FIRST: one
#             window of the five gating bits while the test runs usually names
#             the blocker outright.
#   armwca    trigger on WCA_n going LOW - i.e. on the cache actually being
#             written. If this never triggers while test 2 runs, that is the
#             finding, and it is a stronger statement than any single window.
#   read      upload the capture to ila_cache.csv next to this script
#   status    print capture status and exit
#
# Order of work: program, then boot TPE and load CACHE-1X0-A00 over the serial
# console, THEN arm, then RUN 2, then read. Programming resets the machine, so
# arming before the program step measures nothing.
#
# Written 28-AUG-2026.
