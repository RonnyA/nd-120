# Capture PIL across a real interrupt-level change (build.tcl -tclargs ilacache).
#
# THE QUESTION. Ronny reports that when a test program walks levels 2,3,4,5,6,
# the on-screen panel's ACTIVE LEVEL row lights ALL SIXTEEN segments on every
# change instead of the one level in use.
#
# Three explanations have already died - a PIL clock-domain transient, the
# frame_tick/decay ratio in term_panel, and an accumulation theory. All three
# were reasoned from the source and none was ever measured, which is the whole
# problem: Verilator settles values once per clock, so an intra-cycle transient
# does not exist there at all.
#
# There is also a real chance the row is simply built on the wrong signal. The
# MC68705 panel's ACTIVE LEVEL field shows ACTLV - an accumulated one-hot word
# the microcode sends with LDPANC 0x0A - not PIL. Our row uses PIL.
#
# This script separates those two. Arm on PIL leaving 0 and look at what the
# bus actually does across a level change:
#   - if PIL steps cleanly 2 -> 3 -> 4 with no intermediate codes, the transient
#     theory is dead for good and the row's SOURCE is the fault;
#   - if PIL walks through codes the CPU never ran at, the synchroniser story
#     was right and the gate that was flashed did not go far enough.
#
# Run the TPE INSTRUCTION test (INSTRUCTION-C03) - Ronny's own answer for which
# program drives the levels.
