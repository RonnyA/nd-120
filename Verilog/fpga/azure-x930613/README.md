# ND-120 on the Microsoft Azure FPGA card (X930613-001)

**Status: PAPER PLAN (31-AUG-2026).** No build files exist yet. This folder
only records the card's specs and the open questions that have to be
answered before any Verilog gets written.

Card facts, as given by Ronny (31-AUG-2026) - **not yet independently
verified against a datasheet or the physical card**:

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Product name | Microsoft Azure FPGA 40GbE QSFP+ PCIe |
| Part number | X930613-001 |
| PCB part number | DAT6MTHUEB0 |
| FPGA | Altera (Intel) **Stratix V GS** |
| Main memory | 4 GB DDR3, ECC |
| Network | 2x QSFP+ / 40GbE |
| Host interface | PCIe Gen3 x16 |

I have not verified the exact Stratix V GS variant, the board's clocking,
or its debug access **against a datasheet or the physical card** - the
table above is Ronny's own numbers, unverified by me independently.

A third-party blog, [devops.lol](https://www.devops.lol/) (see Links,
below), identifies this same part number (X930613-001) as the **Microsoft
"Storey Peak" board (Catapult v2)** and gives more specific numbers. A
second report (pasted into this conversation 31-AUG-2026) added more
detail but **was written by ChatGPT, not sourced from the card or a
datasheet** - so before trusting any of it, every checkable claim in it
was run against independent sources: a GitHub issue on the `corundum`
project (corundum/corundum#213), the community reverse-engineering repo
[`ruurdk/storey-peak`](https://github.com/ruurdk/storey-peak), and
[theretroweb.com](https://theretroweb.com/expansioncards/s/microsoft-azure-x930613-001-fpga-card).
Results below - **confirmed** means at least two independent sources
agree; **unverified** means only the ChatGPT report claims it and no
other source was found:

| Item | Value | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Codename | "Storey Peak" (Microsoft Catapult v2) | confirmed (devops.lol, corundum#213, theretroweb) |
| FPGA part | custom **5SGSKF40I3LNAC**, Stratix V GS, DSP-optimized, dual PCIe hard IP | confirmed (devops.lol, ruurdk/storey-peak) |
| PCIe | **physical x16 edge connector, but wired as two bifurcated Gen3 x8 links** - the host motherboard's BIOS **must support PCIe bifurcation** on that slot or only one x8 link (or none) will come up | confirmed (corundum#213, ruurdk/storey-peak) - resolves the x16-vs-dual-x8 mismatch between Ronny's numbers and devops.lol above: it's genuinely both, and bifurcation support is a new hard requirement not in either original report |
| Memory | **4 GB usable ECC** (4.5 GB raw before ECC), DDR3L, 72-bit bus (64 data + 8 ECC), 9x SK Hynix `H5TC4G83BFR` chips | confirmed (corundum#213, ruurdk/storey-peak) |
| Debug access | on-board **FTDI FT232H**, USB-to-JTAG, **no PCB modification or external programmer needed** - Quartus/OpenOCD can use it via community driver/library work | confirmed (devops.lol, corundum#213, ruurdk/storey-peak) |
| Toolchain | **Quartus Prime Standard required** - Quartus Lite's free tier stops at Cyclone V/MAX 10 (which is why the `mister/` DE10-Nano board in this repo gets free tooling and this one doesn't) | confirmed - Stratix V is absent from every Lite device list checked, and Quartus's own Docker image tagged `-all` was pulled and queried directly: it ships only Cyclone V + MAX 10 device files, zero Stratix V |
| GPIO | **none** on the standard interfaces - devops.lol's author rewired a UART through the QSFP+ module's I2C pins to get any general-purpose signal off the board | devops.lol only, unverified elsewhere |
| Onboard flash size | ChatGPT's report claimed "~256 Mbit (32 MB) NOR flash" for persistent config | **unverified - no source found for this number**, treat as a guess until checked against the board itself or a schematic |
| Logic capacity (~457K LE / ~172K ALM / ~40 Mbit BRAM) | ChatGPT's report gave these as "approximate capacity" | **unverified** - 457K LE appears in devops.lol too (so likely a real Stratix V GS family figure), but the ALM and BRAM numbers have no independent source and may just be ChatGPT extrapolating from the LE count |
| Known issues (devops.lol author's) | dual-PCIe-IP selection needed DLL shimming on Windows; Nios II/Eclipse toolchain flaky; DDR3 bus deadlocks were hit building a LiteX-based SoC | devops.lol only, unverified elsewhere |

This is a much harder bring-up target than any board currently in this
repo: a non-catalog FPGA part, Quartus Prime Standard (not Lite/Pro), a
motherboard BIOS bifurcation requirement, no confirmed GPIO, and a
JTAG/UART bridge over a repurposed FTDI chip instead of a normal header.

## Why this board is a different shape from every other target

Every other board in `Verilog/fpga/` is a hobbyist devboard: it has a
UART or USB-JTOG console, a keyboard/VGA path, or an SD card, and it
powers up and runs standalone. This card is a datacenter PCIe accelerator:

- **Toolchain is different.** Every other Altera/Intel target here
  ([`../mister/`](../mister/README.md)) is Cyclone V under Quartus Lite.
  Stratix V needs full **Quartus Prime** (Standard or Pro) - Quartus Lite
  does not support Stratix V. Licensing/availability of that toolchain is
  unconfirmed.
- **No console.** Confirmed no GPIO on the standard interfaces, so OPCOM
  (the direct-UART path every other board uses first) has nowhere to
  attach - a console has to be built over PCIe instead. See
  [`docs/00-plan.md`](docs/00-plan.md) for the design intent.
- **Config is volatile via JTAG, persistence unverified.** A JTAG `.sof`
  load is volatile like every other board here. Whether onboard flash
  supports power-on auto-config is unverified - the flash-size claim in
  the table above has no confirmed source.
- **PCIe bifurcation is a new, real requirement - CONFIRMED SUPPORTED on
  Ronny's board (31-AUG-2026).** The x16 edge connector is two bifurcated
  Gen3 x8 links, not a native x16 link. ASUS's own official bifurcation
  table (support FAQ #1037507) lists the PRIME Z690-P WIFI D4's
  CPU-connected slot (`PCIEX16(G5)_1`) as supporting **2 (X8+X8)** -
  cross-checked against the real E19403 user manual. That slot is
  normally occupied by the GTX 1080, so this still means either swapping
  the GPU out or finding a second GPU-free x16-physical slot; the
  chipset-connected slots on this board are x4-only and don't qualify.
  Still open: the actual BIOS menu path to enable it, and whether a
  non-Hyper-M.2 PCIe device (this card, not ASUS's own Hyper M.2 card)
  negotiates correctly across the split - electrically it should, but
  unproven until tested. See open question 1 in
  [`docs/00-plan.md`](docs/00-plan.md).
- **This does not appear to be a closed/locked platform** - multiple
  independent community projects (see Links) document working JTAG
  access and PCIe driver stacks for this exact card, which weighs against
  the "Microsoft-signed-only" concern raised earlier. Still confirm on
  Ronny's own card before relying on this.
- **No open-source escape from Quartus licensing - checked, confirmed
  absent.** Unlike the Tang Nano 20K's mature yosys+nextpnr+apicula Gowin
  flow in this same repo, Yosys's two Intel/Altera synthesis backends
  (`synth_intel`, `synth_intel_alm`) top out at Cyclone V - Stratix V
  isn't supported by either, and neither has an open place-and-route
  step behind it regardless. Quartus Prime Standard's 30-day unlicensed
  eval unlocks the full feature set (synthesis, fitter, timing) but not
  the final programming-file step, and it's a one-time window per
  machine, not resettable. Full detail and sourcing in
  [`docs/00-plan.md`](docs/00-plan.md).
