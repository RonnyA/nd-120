# EXPERIMENT (no resynth): re-time the routed design at ~39 MHz to measure how
# much of the -40ns WNS is fixed simply by slowing the CPU/sys_clk to original
# ND speed (25.6 ns/state), vs how much is genuine multi-state depth needing
# set_multicycle_path. Routing/placement stay as-is (optimized for 100 MHz), so
# this is a logic-DEPTH check, not a final number - but it decisively tells us
# whether the frequency move is the lever.
#
# Usage (from Verilog\fpga\basys3):
#   & "F:\AMDDesignTools\2025.2.1\Vivado\bin\vivado.bat" -mode batch -source exp_slowclk.tcl
