# DECISIVE TEST (no resynth, ~40s): if we put a timing boundary around the UART
# (treat it as the quasi-static peripheral it is) AND run at 39 MHz, does the
# design close? Applies false_path from/to the UART flops and reports WNS.
# false_path here is an UPPER BOUND on the benefit; the real design would use
# set_multicycle_path, but this tells us if the UART is the whole story.
