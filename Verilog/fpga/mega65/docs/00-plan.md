# MEGA65 port - the living plan

**Next:** send `build/delivery/` (both `.cor` files + the tester note; release names in `fpga/release-staging/`) to
the testers and act on what comes back. Nothing of this port has run on a
real MEGA65 yet.

Delivered 02-SEP-2026 17:01: `nd120_mega65_r6.cor` (SDRAM, CPU 20 MHz,
WNS +0.249 / WHS +0.003 ns) and `nd120_mega65_r3.cor` (HyperRAM, CPU
13.33 MHz, WNS +0.093 / WHS +0.035 ns), both stamped `e5bdea5+ 02-Sep-2026
16:27`. Timing-clean incl. hold; the CGA IDB-loop DRC downgraded exactly as
on the Nexys. Two hold constraints on the framework's clk live in
`CORE/CORE.xdc` (a divider-feedback analysis artefact, and 100 ps of hold
uncertainty because the router's hold estimate sat ~70 ps above sign-off).

Rewritten 02-SEP-2026. Ronny's requirement: the bitstream shall have a
fully working ND-120 CPU, a TDV terminal with keys working, floppy, tape
and Winchester working - for BOTH memory revisions. No console-only or
memtest-only bitstreams go out.

## Decisions (Ronny, 02-SEP-2026)

1. **Both memories, two backends, picked by the board revision at build.**
   - R3 / R3A: the 8 MiB HyperRAM (all it has), through the framework's
     Avalon-MM port and the Nexys variable-latency seam.
   - R4/R5/R6: the 64 MB SDRAM, on the MiSTer/Tang sheet-49 bridge.
2. **MiSTer2MEGA65 (M2M) for everything else:** per-revision tops, keyboard,
   video (VGA + HDMI), virtual drives, OSD, `.cor` packaging. Costs accepted:
   GPL-3 framework as a submodule of an MIT repo, mixed VHDL + Verilog
   build, the QNICE disc-throughput question (unmeasured).
3. **No MEGA65 here. Friends test.** Every bitstream must show its own
   result on the MEGA65's screen and the case LED; one variable per send;
   ask the tester's revision first.

## What is built (02-SEP-2026)

The whole machine, two revisions, one `build.tcl`:

| Piece | File | Proof so far |
|---|---|---|
| CPU board, bus devices, WCS microcode | `ND120_CORE` + the MiSTer `files.qip` list, defines as `fpga/mister/nd120.qsf` minus Quartus-only | boots SINTRAN on the DE10-Nano at these settings |
| Main memory R4-R6 | `MEM_RAM_49_SDRAM` + `sdram18` (ND_SDRAM_PACK16 + DQ16, refresh 7 us), pins through `CORE/vhdl/framework-overrides/top_mega65-r{4,5,6}.vhd` | proven on the DE10-Nano's 16-bit module; the R6 chip is the same shape (32M x 16, A[12:0], BA[1:0]) |
| Main memory R3 | `MEM_RAM_49_DDR2` (Nexys cache + MEM_HOLD) over `rtl/nd_avalon_port.v` on the framework's `hr_core_*` port, window at word 0x200000 | seam proven on the Nexys DDR2; the port passes `sim/nd_avalon_port_tb.v` (burst and single-beat, random wait/latency, 300 random ops); the HyperRAM controller is the framework's, proven in every M2M core |
| Storage | `rtl/nd_storage_vdrives.v` (the MiSTer `nd_storage_hps.v` on vdrives' byte-wide bus) + `rtl/nd_storage_mega65_devices.v` (fd0 fd1 wd0 wd1 tape) | `sim/nd_storage_vdrives_tb.v` (8 checks) and `sim/nd_storage_mega65_devices_tb.v` (floppy R/W both drives, Winchester R/W both units, tape stream/rewind/EOF) against `sim/vdrives_model.v`; the vdrives side is the framework's, proven in the C64 core |
| Console | `Verilog/Terminals/` on the framework's video, `rtl/m65_keys_to_ps2.v` + the shared TDV decoder, 7E1 UART bridge at 115200 | `sim/m65_keys_to_ps2_tb.v` (60 keycap checks), `sim/nd120_console_mega65_tb.v`; the console-only bitstreams (B1) closed timing on both revisions |
| Machine top | `rtl/nd120_mega65_machine.v` (Verilog) under `CORE/vhdl/main.vhd` + `mega65.vhd` (VHDL skin, vdrives x5, HyperRAM port, SDRAM pins, OSD: text colour, panel, cache, HDMI mode) | Verilator lint clean in both memory configurations (`sim/lint_machine.sh sdram|hyperram`); Vivado elaborates and synthesises the whole thing |
| Clocks | `CORE/vhdl/clk.vhd`: one MMCM -> 40 MHz (console pixel + SDRAM bridge), CPU 20 MHz on R4-R6 / **13.333 MHz on R3** (the R3 netlist times the CGA IDB ring through a longer loop-break, 57 ns; the period is made to fit it rather than untiming the internal data bus), 40 MHz @180 SDRAM chip; `CORE.xdc` names them; `build.tcl` bounds cpu_clk<->qnice_clk and cpu_clk<->hr_clk with `set_max_delay -datapath_only` | the bridge's "same PLL" rule holds by construction |
| Packaging | `make all BOARD=r6` / `r3` -> `build/<board>/nd120_mega65_<board>.cor` via `coretool` (model byte, CRC, FPGA-part check); `.cor` version = the banner stamp | `--verify` on both |
| Boot verdict without a monitor | case power LED: amber = self-test running / halted, green = MACL2 reached (self-test passed) | wired from the CPU board's own green lamp |

**First full R6 build (02-SEP 15:32):** synthesis and implementation went
through; WNS -0.174 ns on 17 endpoints that were ONE bug (vdrives' mount
records left in the wrong clock domain - fixed), and 26 hold misses on the
framework's MMCM DRP pins that the router believed it had fixed (its own
summary said +0.053, sign-off said -0.491) - `phys_opt_design -hold_fix`
added after routing, and the timing gate now checks hold too. The
combinatorial-loop DRC alerts (16 loops, same nets, same sizes) exist in
the deployed Nexys build.

## Remote-testing gate (still binding)

1. Every bitstream diagnoses itself on the MEGA65's own screen and LED.
2. Results come back as a photograph: banner with git hash + date + board
   revision + memory, the SINTRAN start-up text, the LED colour.
3. One variable per send.
4. Ask the revision first (RESTORE ~2 s, HELP: "MEGA65 MODEL"); the flash
   menu refuses a wrong-model `.cor`.
5. Everything provable in simulation is proven there first; every new file
   has a bench registered in `Verilog/tests/run_all_tests.sh`.

## Toolchain facts (B0, 02-SEP-2026)

1. `.v` files of the framework must be read as SystemVerilog under 2026.1.
2. `auto_detect_xpm` before `synth_design`, or the XPM CDC false paths are
   never applied (229 phantom failing endpoints).
3. `common.xdc:122` (`-through .../i_ascal/reset_na`) matches nothing under
   2026.1; `CORE/CORE.xdc` restates it against the registers' CLR/PRE pins.
   The framework's own line still prints one CRITICAL WARNING per build.
4. Framework floor on the A200T: ~14.8k LUTs, 55.5 BRAM tiles.
5. `coretool` (mega65-tools, fetched by `make toolchain`, pinned) packs the
   `.cor`; the QNICE submodule's `bit2core` cannot (no model byte).
6. Host prerequisites in WSL: gcc for `qasm`/`qasm2rom`/`monitor.rom`
   (`make toolchain`), `make rom` for the M2M firmware with one `-I` patch
   in `CORE/m2m-rom/make_rom.sh`; both submodules need LF line endings
   (`core.autocrlf false` set locally in each).
7. VHDL file paths in `globals.vhd` resolve relative to the reading VHDL
   file; our `CORE/` is one level above the submodule, so the firmware
   path gained one `../`.

## Open questions only the board can answer

- **HyperRAM latency vs SINTRAN (R3).** MEM_HOLD absorbs it; the number is
  unmeasured. The banner's memory line says which backend a photo is of.
- **QNICE-served disc throughput.** Sized for floppy-class traffic in the
  framework's own cores; SINTRAN pages at Winchester rates. If the machine
  runs but crawls, this is where to look; the fallback is a small
  standalone benchmark bitstream (random-LBA `sd_rd -> ack` on a 75 MB
  image) - never a probe on the SINTRAN console (Ronny, 02-SEP-2026).
- **The R6 SDRAM bridge on this chip.** Same geometry as the DE10-Nano
  module; refresh 7 us for 8192 rows. Unverified on the MEGA65's pins and
  trace lengths; no I/O timing constraints, as on the MiSTer.
- Automount / image folder conventions of the framework (`/nd120`).

## Layout under `Verilog/fpga/mega65/`

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `m2m/` | git submodule -> sy2002/MiSTer2MEGA65 @ `423ba6e`; its own `M2M/QNICE` submodule inside |
| `CORE/` | our side of M2M's `CORE/` contract (the framework's template, edited): `vhdl/mega65.vhd` (wrapper), `vhdl/main.vhd` (VHDL skin over the Verilog machine), `vhdl/clk.vhd`, `vhdl/config.vhd` (OSD texts + menu), `vhdl/globals.vhd` (5 vdrives), `vhdl/framework-overrides/top_mega65-r*.vhd` (SDRAM pins into the core), `CORE.xdc`, `m2m-rom/` (firmware build). Capital CORE because the framework's `#include "../../CORE/..."` depends on it |
| `rtl/` | the Verilog: `nd120_mega65_machine.v`, `nd120_console_mega65.v`, `m65_keys_to_ps2.v`, `nd_storage_mega65_devices.v`, `nd_storage_vdrives.v`, `nd_avalon_port.v` |
| `sim/` | one bench per file + `vdrives_model.v`, `lint_machine.sh`; `make all` runs them; registered in `Verilog/tests/run_all_tests.sh` |
| `build.tcl`, `Makefile` | `make toolchain` once, `make all BOARD=r3|r4|r5|r6` -> `.bit` + `.cor` under `build/<board>/` |
| `docs/SEND-NOTE.md` | what goes to a tester |
| `tools/` | gitignored; `coretool` lands here |

**Isolation rule (Ronny, 27-AUG):** everything for this port lives under
`fpga/mega65/`. The one shared-RTL change: `Verilog/Terminals/` gained
`hblank`/`vblank` outputs (additive; the framework needs the two halves of
`de`).
