** ND120 - FIRST PAGE-FAULT FREEZE REGISTER                                 **
**                                                                          **
** WHAT THIS IS FOR                                                         **
**   On the Tang, SINTRAN halts in ERRFATAL reporting IIC 3 (page fault).    **
**   Nobody knows whether that page fault is REAL. This block captures the   **
**   inputs to the trap logic at the exact TCLK edge that latched the        **
**   vector, then LOCKS, so the evidence survives the rest of the boot and   **
**   can be read out afterwards.                                            **
**                                                                          **
**   It answers one question with no inference:                             **
**     PT valid, permission bits genuinely clear   -> a REAL page fault      **
**     PT all zero while the page-table RAM is                              **
**       mid-read                                  -> SPURIOUS              **
**     PT valid and GRANTING                       -> something other than   **
**                                                    PGF raised the trap    **
**                                                                          **
** WHY A FREEZE REGISTER AND NOT A TRACE BUFFER                             **
**   The event is one-shot and self-announcing: the machine halts moments    **
**   after it. One frozen sample of the right cycle is worth more than a     **
**   rolling window that may not be centred on it, and it costs ~80 flip-    **
**   flops instead of BSRAM this design has none to spare.                   **
**                                                                          **
** THE TIMING SUBTLETY THAT DECIDES WHETHER THIS BLOCK IS USEFUL AT ALL     **
**   TVEC_3_0 is REGISTERED on TCLK. So by the time TVEC reads "page fault", **
**   the inputs that caused it have already moved on. Sampling the inputs    **
**   at the same moment TVEC is observed would capture the WRONG CYCLE and   **
**   produce a confident, wrong answer.                                     **
**   Therefore: the inputs are snapshotted on EVERY capturing edge into a    **
**   one-deep "previous edge" register, and when TVEC then shows a page      **
**   fault, it is that PREVIOUS snapshot which is frozen. The testbench      **
**   CGA_PF_CAPTURE_tb.v exists specifically to prove this lands on the      **
**   right cycle - do not trust the block without it.                       **
**                                                                          **
** LATCH MODE vs FF MODE                                                    **
**   In FPGA_FF_MODE the vector flip-flops are clocked by sysclk qualified   **
**   with a TCLK_EN pulse. In the default build they are clocked by TCLK     **
**   directly. This block follows whichever is in use, so the captured       **
**   cycle means the same thing in both.                                     **
**                                                                          **
