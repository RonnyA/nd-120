mmu_177777_probe.py - investigate STA -> logical 177777 (top page) store routing.

QUESTION (from PROBE-DESIGN.md): when a PAGED store targets logical address
177777 (the very top word of the address space), does the write land in MAIN
memory or in the MMU SHADOW map? A suspected top-page routing bug would send it
to the wrong place.

METHODOLOGY (anti-assume discipline):
  - We instrument the MMU shadow-write strobe s_wmap_n. From CPU_MMU_24.v:
        assign s_wmap_n = ~(s_lshadow & s_write & s_cyd);
    so s_wmap_n==0  <=>  a SHADOW-map write is in flight this cycle.
  - The logical page is read from s_la_20_10 (LA bits 20:10). For the top page
    those upper bits are all ones (o3777 = 0x7FF).
  - We add TWO detectors so a harness that never issues a paged store can NEVER
    masquerade as a top-page bug:
        top_shadow  : s_wmap_n==0 && s_la_20_10==o3777   (the case under test)
        ctrl_shadow : s_wmap_n==0 && s_la_20_10!=o3777   (CONTROL: normal paged store)
  - The FST is gated ON only while a top-page shadow store is in flight, so the
    resulting waveform is tiny and focused.
  - Finally we backdoor-examine MAIN RAM at 177777.

HONEST LIMITATIONS stated up front:
  * The backdoor examines MAIN RAM only (the b0_* arrays). The MMU SHADOW array
    is a separate memory not exposed by the RAM backdoor, so "landed in shadow"
    is INFERRED from the shadow-write strobe firing for that address, not read
    back from the shadow array.
  * INSTRUCTION-B.BPUN is a CPU self-test, not a paging exerciser. If it never
    turns paging on (PON) or never issues a paged store, this run CANNOT answer
    the routing question - and the script says so instead of inventing a bug.
