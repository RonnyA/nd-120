r"""FST-relative datapath trace around the R corruption (FIDBO/A_REG=0x00FF).
FST timestamps are 0-based (reset when fst_on fired ~71.600M abs). The R fill maps to
FST-rel ~441455 ps. Snapshot all CGA/ALU/WRF datapath signals over a window before it,
print each signal's value trajectory, and find where byte 0x52 ('R') becomes 0xFF."""
