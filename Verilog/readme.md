| DELILAH-CPU      | Logisim drawing complete | Verilog compiles - Missing a lot of testcases  |
| DECODE-GateArray | Logisim drawing complete | Verilog compiles - Missing a lot of testcases  |
| CPU-BOARD-3202   | No logisim drawings yet  | Maybe code directly in Verilog ?               | Need to implement support chips like UART and all PAL's |
