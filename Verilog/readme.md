# Verilog code

The Verilog code has been split into subfolder matching the structure of the LogiSim and Design Documents

1. DELILAH-CPU
2. DECODE-GateArray
3. CPU-BOARD-3202



| Folder           | Status   |  
|------------------|----------|
| DELILAH-CPU      | Verilog compiles - Missing a lot of testcases  |
| DECODE-GateArray | Waiting for completion of Logisim drawings  |
| CPU-BOARD-3202   | No logisim drawings yet. Maybe code directly in Verilog |
