//! Plan: Verilog/Terminals/docs/PLAN-vt100-terminal-core.md
//!
//! This is the whole Stage A terminal: give it console bytes on any clock and
//! it gives you a monochrome pixel stream with sync. It knows nothing about
//! any board - no VGA connector, no HDMI scaler, no keyboard. Each board wires
//! the two ends:
//!
//!   Nexys 4 DDR : deserialize cpu_txd into byte_in; pixel -> the 12-bit VGA
//!                 pins; keyboard from the onboard USB host as plain PS/2
//!   MiSTer      : ps2_key from hps_io; pixel -> CLK_VIDEO/CE_PIXEL/VGA_*
//!   MEGA65      : mega65 keyboard matrix; pixel -> the VDAC
//!
//! Keyboard input is NOT handled here - a keyboard produces bytes that go back
//! to the machine, which is the board's business, not the screen's.

    // CLOCK-DOMAIN CROSSING for every panel signal
    //
    // These all come from the CPU clock domain and are sampled here in the
    // PIXEL domain. Reading them directly - which is what this did until
    // 28-AUG-2026 - is a genuine CDC violation, and PIL showed exactly why.
    //
    // PIL is four bits that change together. Sampled asynchronously they
    // arrive SKEWED, so a transition like 7 -> 8 (0111 -> 1000) is seen as
    // whatever intermediate codes the individual bits happen to produce -
    // including 1111. That transient got latched into the afterglow and lit
    // level 15, on a machine that never uses level 15. Reported from hardware
    // as "level 15 lights a lot and level 15 is NEVER used", which is precisely
    // what a skewed multi-bit crossing looks like once something downstream
    // remembers what it saw.
    //
    // Two flops for metastability, then - for the multi-bit bus - a stability
    // gate: a value is only accepted once it has held still for a while.
    //
    // TWO SAMPLES WAS NOT ENOUGH - 28-AUG-2026. The first version accepted a
    // value as soon as two consecutive samples agreed, and compared one of
    // them against s_pil_m, the FIRST flop of the synchroniser, which is the
    // one allowed to be metastable. Comparing against a metastable flop is not
    // a stability test at all.
    //
    // It also could not reject what PIL actually does. PIL is STS[11:8]
    // (CGA_ALU.v:134) - the level field of a status register that is selected
    // PER LEVEL, so on a level change the bus settles through intermediate
    // codes before it lands. At 40 MHz pixel clock against a 16.67 MHz CPU
    // clock, one CPU cycle of transient spans about 2.4 pixel samples, which
    // walks straight through a two-sample gate. Downstream, term_panel USED TO
    // reload an afterglow counter for pil on EVERY clock, so a single transient
    // code lit that lamp for the whole ~1 s afterglow. Ronny's report -
    // levels walking 2,3,4,5,6 and "every time the level changes all the
    // levels light up" - looked like exactly that shape.
    //
    // So: three flops, the comparison taken between the SECOND and THIRD (both
    // past the metastable one), and the value accepted only after it has been
    // identical for 8 consecutive samples - 200 ns at 40 MHz, comfortably
    // longer than a CPU cycle. Any code the bus merely passes through on its
    // way somewhere else is discarded.
    //
    // MEASURED ON HARDWARE 29-AUG-2026, AND IT WAS NOT THE CAUSE. Two ILA
    // captures of s_ila_pil on the Nexys (TPE INSTRUCTION test) show a level
    // change as ONE clean transition with no intermediate codes - the bus is
    // fine. What the captures did show is PIL genuinely pulsing to 12, 13,
    // 14, 15 for 15 CPU clocks each (~1 us), and the 63-frame afterglow in
    // term_panel stretched each 1 us blip into a lamp lit for a second. That
    // afterglow is gone - term_panel now shows per-frame occupancy. This gate
    // stays because it is harmless and the reasoning above about a transient
    // code is still sound for a bus that does glitch; it just fixes nothing
    // here.
