//! What fraction of the time was this signal high? Answer in eighths.
//!
//! Part of the board-independent terminal core (Verilog/Terminals/).
//!
//! Feeds the operator panel's UTILIZATION and CACHE HIT RATE bargraphs. The
//! real panel showed both as growing bars, and both are rates, not levels - the
//! machine gives us a single-cycle boolean (LEV0 is high while running at level
//! 0; HIT is high on a cache hit) and the bar is how often it was true.
//!
//! Counts high cycles over a window of 2^WINDOW_BITS clocks, then reports the
//! top three bits of that ratio, so the output is 0..8 eighths - exactly the
//! nine bargraph glyphs font/make_font.py synthesises.
//!
//! The result is held while the next window accumulates, so the bar never shows
//! a partial count. Without that it would flicker toward zero at the start of
//! every window, which reads as a machine going idle when it is not.
