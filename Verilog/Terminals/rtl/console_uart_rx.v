//============================================================================
//! Console UART receiver - deserializes the ND-120's console TX line
//!
//! Part of the board-independent terminal core (Verilog/Terminals/).
//!
//! WHY THIS EXISTS. The terminal wants bytes; the machine emits an RS-232 bit
//! stream. The clean thing would be to tap the byte inside the console UART
//! before it is serialized - but that UART is `SC2661_UART` in
//! CPU-BOARD-3202/circuit/IO_UART_42.v, shared RTL used by every board and by
//! the Verilator reference, so adding a port there means re-running the whole
//! unit suite. Deserializing the line costs one small module, touches no
//! shared code, and has the side benefit of exercising the REAL framing.
//!
//! FRAMING IS NOT A CONSTANT. The SC2661 is software programmable - baud and
//! framing are set at run time by the machine, not fixed in RTL. This repo's
//! own console.ps1:17 says the OPCOM console is "7E1 in some configurations;
//! the board check is plain 8N1", and the deployed fast builds run 115200.
//! So the parameters below MUST be set to match whatever the machine is
//! actually programmed to, and getting them wrong shows up immediately as
//! garbage on screen. (The MEGA65 plan's claim of "7E2" is not confirmed
//! anywhere - do not copy that number without checking.)
//!
//! Parity is RECEIVED BUT NOT CHECKED: the bit is consumed so the framing
//! stays aligned, and that is all. A parity error on a console line means one
//! wrong character on screen, which the reader can see; dropping the character
//! instead would hide it.
//!
