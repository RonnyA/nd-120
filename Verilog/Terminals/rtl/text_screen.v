//============================================================================
//! Text screen - turns the character RAM into pixels
//!
//! Part of the board-independent terminal core (Verilog/Terminals/).
//!
//! Owns the VGA timing generator, the character RAM read port and the font
//! ROM, and produces one monochrome pixel per pixel clock plus the sync and
//! blanking signals. Colour is applied by the board (12-bit on the Nexys, the
//! framework video mixer on MiSTer) - this module says "ink or paper", which
//! is all a terminal needs and keeps it portable.
//!
//! THE PIPELINE (the part that is easy to get wrong):
//!
//!   t+0  address the character RAM with the cell containing pixel X
//!   t+1  character code is out; address the font ROM with it + the pixel row
//!   t+2  the font's 8-pixel row is out; select bit X[2:0] and emit it
//!
//! So the pixel emitted at time t belongs to the pixel position the counters
//! held at t-2. Everything that must line up with it - de, hsync, vsync and
//! the low 3 bits of x - is delayed by the same two clocks. Delaying sync
//! along with the data (rather than compensating the address) keeps the whole
//! frame internally consistent; it shifts the image 2 pixels, which no monitor
//! and no human can see.
//!
//! Hardware scrolling: the visible top line is `top_row`, not row 0. Scrolling
//! is then one register increment instead of moving 1920 words, and the screen
//! is a ring. terminal_ctrl owns that register and clears the newly exposed
//! line.
