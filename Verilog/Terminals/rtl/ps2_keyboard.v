//============================================================================
//! PS/2 keyboard receiver + scancode-set-2 to ASCII decoder
//!
//! Part of the board-independent terminal core (Verilog/Terminals/).
//!
//! Receive-only: this reads the keyboard, it never writes to it (no LED
//! updates, no typematic-rate programming). A keyboard powers up in scancode
//! set 2 with sensible repeat settings, which is all a console needs.
//!
//! WHY PS/2 ON BOARDS WITH USB: neither of our targets makes us write a USB
//! stack. On the Nexys 4 DDR the onboard microcontroller is the USB host and
//! presents the FPGA a plain PS/2 clock/data pair (the board's master XDC
//! literally heads that section "##USB HID (PS/2)", pins F4/B2). On MiSTer,
//! Linux does the USB work and hps_io hands over `ps2_key`. Same protocol,
//! two different machines doing the hard part for us.
//!
//! PROTOCOL: the keyboard drives the clock. Each frame is 11 bits, sampled on
//! the FALLING edge of ps2_clk: start bit (0), 8 data bits LSB first, odd
//! parity, stop bit (1). A frame that fails parity or framing is DROPPED - a
//! corrupted scancode that reaches the decoder can leave the shift state stuck
//! on, which is far worse than a missed keystroke.
//!
//! DECODING: 0xF0 prefixes a key RELEASE, 0xE0 prefixes an EXTENDED key. So
//! "release left shift" arrives as F0 12, and a right-arrow press as E0 74.
//! Modifier state is tracked; everything else is looked up.
//!
//! !! THE ASCII TABLE IS TRANSCRIBED FROM THE PUBLISHED SET-2 TABLES AND HAS
//! !! NOT BEEN CHECKED AGAINST A PHYSICAL KEYBOARD. The testbench proves the
//! !! protocol and the state machine, not the table. Checking the table is
//! !! exactly phase 3 of fpga/nexys4ddr/PLAN-vga-console.md - type on a real
//! !! keyboard and read the screen. Treat every entry as a claim until then.
//!
//! Written 27-AUG-2026.
