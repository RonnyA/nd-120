//============================================================================
//! Everything that decides WHICH byte the terminal displays next.
//!
//! Part of the board-independent terminal core (Verilog/Terminals/).
//!
//! Contains the power-on banner and the priority between the three possible
//! sources. Drop this between a board's byte sources and terminal_top and the
//! board has a self-testing console.
//!
//! WHY THIS IS A MODULE AND NOT TEN LINES IN EACH BOARD'S TOP LEVEL. It was
//! ten lines in the MiSTer glue first, and one of them was wrong in a way that
//! took a testbench to find (the s_banner_done gating below). Every board
//! needs the same ten lines. Copying logic that has already been got wrong
//! once, into two more places, is how a fixed bug comes back.
//!
//! PRIORITY, strictly:
//!   1. the banner - owns the screen until it has finished, then never speaks
//!      again. If it had to share, a machine that starts talking immediately
//!      would interleave with it and the self-test message would be unreadable
//!      exactly when something is wrong.
//!   2. the machine
//!   3. local echo, for boards with no machine attached yet
//!
