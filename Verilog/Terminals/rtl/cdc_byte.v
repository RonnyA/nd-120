//! Single-byte clock-domain crossing, toggle handshake
//!
//! Part of the board-independent terminal core (Verilog/Terminals/).
//!
//! Carries one byte at a time from the source clock (the CPU/UART domain) to
//! the destination clock (the pixel domain). A toggle handshake, not a FIFO,
//! and deliberately so: the console byte rate is glacial next to the pixel
//! clock - 115200 baud is a byte roughly every 87 us, while a 40 MHz pixel
//! clock ticks every 25 ns - so a single-entry crossing can never be the
//! bottleneck, and it has none of the ways an asynchronous FIFO can be got
//! subtly wrong.
//!
//! How it works: the source flips `s_toggle` once per accepted byte and holds
//! the data steady. The destination synchronizes the toggle through two flops
//! and emits one `dst_valid` pulse on each edge. The data is sampled on the
//! destination side only after the toggle has arrived, by which time it has
//! been stable for at least two destination clocks - so the data bits need no
//! synchronizers of their own, which is the whole point of doing it this way.
//!
//! `src_ready` is low while a byte is still in flight. The caller must not
//! present a new byte until it is high again.
//!
//! Written 27-AUG-2026.
