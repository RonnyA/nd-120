//! ND-120 operator panel, drawn below the console text.
//!
//! Part of the board-independent terminal core (Verilog/Terminals/).
//!
//! Recreates the machine's own folio panel in the empty screen area under the
//! 80x25 grid. Geometry and legends come from the photographed hardware
//! (Pictures/ronny/20230618_193546.jpg, active-levels.png), and the FIELDS come
//! from the original schematic: the ND-120's panel processor - an MC68705U3 at
//! board position 35C, sheet 40 of 50 dated 5-OCT-1987, transcribed in this
//! repo as IO_PANCAL_40.v - samples exactly these signals on its Port D:
//!
//!   PD0/PD1  PCR0/PCR1   -> PROTECT RING
//!   PD2      PONI        -> PAGING     ON/OFF
//!   PD3      IONI        -> INTERRUPT  ON/OFF
//!   PD4      LHIT        -> CACHE HIT RATE
//!   PD5      LEV0        -> UTILIZATION   (idle == running at level 0)
//!
//! So the panel is a VIEW of signals the machine already computes. Nothing here
//! is invented, and where a field has no honest source it is not drawn.
//!
//! TWO DELIBERATE DEPARTURES FROM THE REAL PANEL, both because the alternative
//! would be a display that looks right and is wrong:
//!
//!   CURRENT LEVEL, not ACTIVE LEVEL. The real display lights every level that
//!   is active at once, fed from the microprogram in PANC packets, with
//!   afterglow so a single instruction on a level stays visible. We have PIL -
//!   the one level running now. The picture would be identical and the claim
//!   would not, so the caption is changed. There is NO afterglow any more: a
//!   lamp shows the levels used during the frame being drawn, and nothing
//!   older (see the per-frame occupancy note below for why the afterglow was
//!   the bug that lit the whole row).
//!
//!   UP:hh:mm:ss, not DAY/TIME. The real clock is a battery-backed MM58274 that
//!   survives a power failure. There is no panel processor in our RTL and no
//!   calendar; this counts from reset and is labelled as uptime.
//!
//! It has its OWN font ROM rather than sharing the console's. That costs about
//! two block RAMs and buys the absence of an arbiter between two renderers on a
//! 2-clock pipeline - a trade worth making on a part with 100+ of them.

  // The inputs change on the CPU's schedule, not the beam's: PIL moves every

  // glyph not even rendering consistently down its own 16 rows. That is what
  // "shadows on the boxes" and "unstable rendering" were on hardware.
  //
  // The STATUS fields go slower still. PROTECT RING, INTERRUPT and PAGING
  // flipping the instant an instruction changes them is not what the real
  // machine did - its panel processor sends packets every 20 ms and the LCD has
  // response time on top, which Ronny puts at 200-300 ms. SLOW_FRAMES gives

  //!
  //! The ND-100 Reference Manual, on the ACTIVE LEVEL display:
  //!
  //!   "There are 16 positions (0-15), one for each level. A one ( I ) is set
  //!    in ONE of these positions, indicating the active level."
  //!
  //! Singular. One position at a time. The problem is that a 60 Hz screen
  //! cannot show a level the CPU visits for a microsecond unless something
  //! stretches the visit, and the way it was stretched here was the bug.
  //!
  //! HISTORY OF THE BUG (measured on the Nexys with an ILA, 29-AUG-2026, TPE
  //! INSTRUCTION test): PIL pulses to 12, 13, 14, 15 for exactly 15 CPU clocks
  //! each - about 1 us - with ~150 clocks at level 0 in between. The machine
  //! never RUNS at those levels, it touches them. The previous code reloaded
  //! an afterglow counter for `pil` on EVERY clock and decayed it one step per
  //! frame over 63 frames (~1 s; the version before that used 15 frames and
  //! had the same fault four times less visibly). A 1 us blip therefore became
  //! a lamp lit for a whole second, every level the microcode brushes past
  //! stayed lit, and the row saturated - "ACTIVE LEVEL shows all 16 segments".
  //!
  //! Now: `s_seen` accumulates a one-hot of every level PIL takes during the
  //! frame being drawn. At `frame_tick` that vector is latched into `r_lamp`
  //! (below) and `s_seen` starts again, seeded with the level current at the
  //! tick so a level that is live across the boundary is never dropped. The
  //! smear is one frame (~16 ms) instead of ~1 s, and a level the CPU has
  //! stopped using is dark on the very next frame. It still shows several
  //! lamps when the CPU really does touch several levels inside one frame,
  //! because that is true.
  //!
  //! TWO states: full box or blank. An earlier version left a thin bar behind
  //! as a "fading" trace, which read as debris. The real LCD cell is either
  //! showing its segment or it is not.
  //!
  //! Counted in FRAMES, not clocks: the frame rate is 60 Hz in both video
  //! modes while the pixel clock is not, so the window is the same length at
  //! 800x600 and at 1080p.
  //!
  //! What the real machine shows here is ACTLV - the "levels active" word the
  //! microcode sends the panel processor as LDPANC 0x0A - which is state, not
  //! a sampled bus. PIL has no counterpart on the real panel. This is the
  //! least-wrong thing to do with PIL; a latched-ACTLV row is the right end
  //! state now that panel commands reach the FIFO (commits 1a8c0e1/d80ef7f).
