//! Power-on message sender - walks term_banner_rom into the terminal.
//!
//! Part of the board-independent terminal core (Verilog/Terminals/).
//!
//! WHY A BANNER IS WORTH REAL GATES. It turns one useless symptom into two
//! useful ones. Without it a board that shows nothing could be a dead pixel
//! clock, a bad sync, an empty font ROM, a stuck character RAM, a keyboard
//! that never decodes, or a console seam that never delivers a byte. With it:
//!
//!   text appears           -> clock, sync, font, character RAM, scroll and
//!                             the whole write path are all working, and the
//!                             fault is downstream of them
//!   text appears, typing
//!   does nothing           -> the keyboard half alone
//!   nothing at all         -> the video half alone
//!
//! On a board on the desk that saves an hour. On a board belonging to a friend
//! in another country - which is how the MEGA65 will be tested, see
//! fpga/mega65/docs/00-plan.md - it is the difference between one round trip
//! and three, where each round trip is days.
//!
//! It sends ONCE per reset and then gets out of the way for good: `done` goes
//! high and `valid` never rises again, so the machine's own output cannot
//! collide with it.

  //! still high from the previous cycle - so if `ready` happened to be high
  //! that cycle the terminal would accept the NUL and print a stray glyph

  //! RIGHT NOW means a terminator is never offered in the first place.
