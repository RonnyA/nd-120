**Full path:** `Verilog/Terminals/docs/SPEC-tdv2200.md`
Answered 27-AUG-2026 by `retroterm-09`, read out of RetroTerm's source rather
than the OCR documents. RetroTerm is MIT and Ronny's own, so this is a clean
source with no licence question. Where something was a guess, it says so.

Companion to [PLAN-vt100-terminal-core.md](PLAN-vt100-terminal-core.md).

## CORRECTION, 27-AUG-2026: the C0 codes are not the ASCII ones

Ronny pointed out that the escape sequences are documented in RetroTerm's own
`docs/` folder and in its code - which they are, in detail. Reading them
changed the design, and two of the corrections were things a live trace would
have shown only after a wasted build.

**Source:** `E:\Dev\Ronny\RetroTerm\docs\TDV-COMPLETE-ESCAPE-SEQUENCE-REFERENCE.md`
and `TDV-COMPREHENSIVE-REFERENCE.md`, cross-checked against each other, plus
`TDV-DLE-CURSOR-BUG-FIX.md`.

### The TDV C0 set (implemented in terminal_ctrl_tdv.v)

| Byte | Name | TDV meaning | What ANSI would have done |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0x02 | STX | video OFF (screen kept) | - |
| 0x03 | ETX | video ON | - |
| 0x04 | EOT | **erase line** | - |
| 0x05/06/15 | ENQ/ACK/NAK | LED 1/2/3 on | - |
| 0x07 | BEL | bell | same |
| 0x08 | BS | cursor left | same |
| 0x09 | HT | tab | same |
| 0x0A/0B | LF/VT | cursor down | same |
| **0x0C** | **FF** | **ROLL UP (scroll)** | **clear the screen** |
| 0x0D | CR | column 0 | same |
| 0x0E/0F | SO/SI | **disputed - see below** | - |
| **0x10** | **DLE** | **cursor addressing, 2 bytes follow** | - |
| 0x16 | SYN | all lamps off | - |
| 0x17 | ETB | ROLL DOWN | - |
| 0x18 | CAN | cursor right | - |
| **0x19** | **EM** | **ERASE PAGE** | - |
| 0x1C | FS | cursor up | - |
| 0x1D | GS | cursor home | - |

**The expensive one: FF is a scroll, not a clear.** An ANSI reading wipes the
screen every time SINTRAN rolls the page. EM is the clear. Both were wrong in
our first cut and are now right, with a testbench that fails if they are
swapped back.

### DLE - cursor addressing with no escape sequence at all

`DLE row col` - three bytes. Row is the next byte masked `0b0001_1111`,
column the byte after masked `0b0111_1111`, both 0-based.

**SINTRAN positions the cursor this way** - confirmed by a live RX capture of
terminal type 53 (`TDV-DLE-CURSOR-BUG-FIX.md`). That is the single most useful
fact in this whole document: full-screen cursor addressing costs a three-state
machine and **no escape parser**, so a lot of what looked like Stage B is
already reachable in Stage A.

**Doc defect, confirmed by RetroTerm's own bug report:**
`TDV-COMPLETE-ESCAPE-SEQUENCE-REFERENCE.md` says the COLUMN mask is 5 bits,
which cannot express the documented range 0-79. The code uses 7 bits and the
bug-fix report calls the 5-bit figure a doc defect. **We use 7 bits**, and the
testbench specifically addresses column 79 so a regression to 5 bits fails.

### SO (0x0E) and SI (0x0F) - RESOLVED, and the answer was "both"

Both documents are correct. They describe different **modes**, and neither
names the mode it applies in - which is why they read as a contradiction.
RetroTerm implements both (confirmed by retroterm-09, 27-AUG-2026):

| Mode | SO (0x0E) | SI (0x0F) | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| native TDV2200/2215 | invoke G1 | invoke G0 | `TDV2200Emulator.cs:303-306` |
| 2115 compatibility | underline ON | underline OFF | `TDV2115CompatibilityHandler.cs:218-234` |

2115 mode is entered by ND private mode 66 - **the same mode that swaps the
whole keyboard encoding** from `ESC[nn_` to single C0 bytes (rule C above). So
the two meanings travel together: implement 2115 mode and SO/SI change meaning
along with the keyboard.

**We do not implement 2115 mode**, so the G1/G0 reading is correct for every
case our terminal can reach. `terminal_ctrl.v` tracks it on a `charset`
output. Nothing renders differently yet - there is one font page - but the
state is carried rather than dropped, so a second font page is only a wiring
job.

The comment in RetroTerm's own 2115 handler is worth keeping, because whoever
wrote it hit this exact question:

> "0x0E SO / 0x0F SI. Here they mean Underline / Normal, a 2115 attribute
> feature. Outside 2115 mode they are Shift Out / Shift In - G1/G0 invocation -
> which the emulator already handles. Routing them here would silently break
> character-set switching."

**The doc defect is real but is not "one of them is stale".** Both are
INCOMPLETE in the same way - each states its meaning without naming the mode.
That is worse than a wrong entry, because both readers come away confident.

## Stage A is enough for a login - and this is MEASURED, not assumed

retroterm-09 logged into a live SINTRAN III VSX/500 console (RetroCore
emulated ND-100, port 9010): ESC, login as SYSTEM, `@WHO-IS-ON`. The whole
exchange - banner, ENTER/PASSWORD prompts, the `@` prompt, the terminal
listing - was **plain text with CR/LF**. RetroTerm's "what did I receive and
not act on" report came back **nothing unhandled**, and nothing on screen
needed cursor addressing.

So a glass TTY - printable ASCII, CR, LF, BS, BEL - genuinely gets a SINTRAN
login and the `@`-command loop. **That is Stage A, and it is now backed by
evidence rather than by our hope.**

What the full-screen tools need (the LED editor, QED, the ND-500 monitor
screens) is **largely answered by the documents above, not by a trace**: the
TDV C0 set plus DLE cursor addressing is what they position with, and DLE is
confirmed against a live SINTRAN capture. If a gap turns up later, the next
place to look is RetroTerm's `docs/` folder and its emulator code - not a new
measurement. That was Ronny's point, and it was right.

## Geometry - 80 x 25, NOT 80 x 24

From RetroTerm's `EmulatorFactory` (line ~200): TDV 2200 and TDV 2215 are
**80 columns by 25 rows**. Our first cut said 24; corrected in the RTL on
27-AUG-2026. A whole row is a whole row of BRAM and a scroll region off by one.

## The grammar - why a VT100 parser is not enough

TDV extended control keys use **`ESC [ nn _`** - CSI, two DECIMAL digits,
terminator **underscore (0x5F)**. 0x5F is **outside the ANSI final-byte range
0x40-0x7E**, so an ECMA-48 parser never terminates on it. The CSI state needs
`_` added as a final, or its own state.

ND-specific CSI finals (`TDVEmulatorBase.IsNDSpecificFinal`):

| Final | Name | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `z` | NDSAR | set attribute over a RECTANGLE |
| `u` | NDSREC | save rectangle |
| `v` | NDRREC | restore rectangle |
| `~` | NDDWA | define work area |
| `<` | NDVIDEO | alpha/graphics toggle |

A VT100 parser silently swallows all five. ND private modes (`CSI ? n h/l`)
include **66** (2115 compatibility), **67** NDSSM smooth scroll, **68** NDBLWM
blink, **69** enhanced blink.

## The keyboard - the rules matter more than the table

Source of truth:
`src\RetroTerm.Core\Terminal\Emulators\TDV\TDV2200KeyRegistry.cs` (1303 lines).
Each key is one `Reg(gridPosition, name, colour, flags, vk, extNormal,
extShift, extCtrl, simpleAscii, numPadFunc)` - **five possible encodings per
key**. That, not the byte values, is what will cost time.

### Rule A - shifted is unshifted PLUS ONE

Holds across the whole table. Store one base number per key and add the shift
bit; do not build 60 separate constants.

| Key | Base | Key | Base |
|---|---|---|---|
| MERK | 00 | STRYK | 10 |
| FELT | 02 | KOPI | 12 |
| AVSH | 04 | FLYTT | 14 |
| SETN | 06 | TAB | 16 |
| ORD | 08 | SEARCH | 18 |
| REPLACE | 20 | FUNK | 42 |
| SKRIV | 44 | HJELP | 46 |
| SLUTT | 48 | F1 | 50 |
| F2 | 52 | F3 | 55 |
| F4 | 58 | NEWPARA | 86 |

Only F2 and F3 have a ctrl variant, at base+2.

### Rule B - arrows and HOME are NEVER escape sequences

**Checked against the code, because a doc said otherwise.**
`docs\TDV-KEYBOARD-COMPLETE-REFERENCE.md` has a table claiming the arrows send
`ESC [ A/B/C/D` in "TDV2200 Extended" mode and C0 codes only in 2115 mode.
`TDV2200KeyRegistry.cs` disagrees, and the registry is the source of truth:

```csharp
Reg("C48","UP",   ...AlwaysSameCode, 38, "","",null,"",null);
Reg("A48","DOWN", ...AlwaysSameCode, 40, "","",null,"",null);
Reg("B47","LEFT", ...AlwaysSameCode, 37, "","",null,"",null);
Reg("B49","RIGHT",...AlwaysSameCode, 39, "","",null,"",null);
Reg("B48","HOME", ...AlwaysSameCode, 36, "","",null,"",null);
```

Same C0 byte in the normal, shift AND simple-ASCII columns, with the flag
`AlwaysSameCode`. **So the C0 codes are right and that doc table is wrong** -
a third document in this family that turned out to be a claim rather than a
fact. HOME is the exception the registry itself shows: 0x1D native, 0x10 in
Simple ASCII, exactly as stated below.

Implemented in `ps2_ascii_table_tdv.v`, with the registry lines quoted in the
source, so the next person does not have to re-do this.

#### The whole table was wrong, not just that row (retroterm-09, 27-AUG-2026)

Reported back, and retroterm-09 checked every row against the registry: the
"Navigation Keys" table **was a VT220 table wearing a TDV label**. Fixed on
its side in commit `d993a14` with a regression test. What the keys actually
are - this matters for Stage C, because two of them are not what a PC keyboard
would suggest:

| Grid | The doc said | **Reality (registry)** |
|---|---|---|
| arrows | `ESC[A/B/C/D` natively | **C0 bytes in EVERY mode**, AlwaysSameCode |
| HOME | `ESC[H` native / 0x1D in 2115 | **INVERTED**: 0x1D native, 0x10 in 2115 |
| D47 | "Page Down", `ESC[6~` | **ROLLUP** - `ESC[28_` / shift `ESC[29_` / 2115 0x06 |
| D49 | "Page Up", `ESC[5~` | **ROLLDN** - `ESC[32_` / shift `ESC[33_` / 2115 0x05 |
| C49 | "Insert", `ESC[2~` | **FIELDRIGHT** - `ESC[36_` |
| G47 | "Delete", `ESC[3~` | **STRYK** - `ESC[10_` |
| END | `ESC[F` | **there is no END key on a TDV** - returns null |
| F1-F12 | `ESC[11~` for F1 | **F1 = `ESC[50_`** (rule A base 50) |
| PUSH P1-P8 | `ESC[?n~` | **no fixed sequence exists at all** |

**Consequence for our Stage C key mapping:** a PC Page Up / Page Down should
map to **ROLLDN / ROLLUP**, not to any VT-style page sequence - and there is
nothing for a PC END key to send. Our Stage A behaviour (extended keys with no
TDV equivalent send NOTHING) is already right and stays right.

There is no VT220-ish TDV mode that would have made the doc true: DECCKM does
rewrite `ESC[A` into `ESC O A`, but only in the VT100/VT220 mapper classes,
which are never in the path for a TDV. The document had simply been written
from VT knowledge.


Bare C0 bytes, identical in every mode (flag `AlwaysSameCode`):

| Key | Byte | Key | Byte |
|---|---|---|---|
| UP | 0x1C | DOWN | 0x0B |
| LEFT | 0x08 | RIGHT | 0x18 |
| HOME | 0x1D | RETURN | 0x0D |
| DEL | 0x7F | | |

A real difference from VT100 - **no `ESC [ A`**. Emit VT100 arrows and the
SINTRAN full-screen tools will not see cursor keys at all. Note LEFT = 0x08 =
backspace, and HOME = 0x1D (0x10 in Simple ASCII mode - the one key whose code
changes between modes).

### Rule C - Simple ASCII mode (2115 compatibility, ND private mode 66)

Replaces the escape sequences with single C0 bytes: FELT 0x02, AVSH 0x01,
SETN 0x03, TAB 0x09, SEARCH 0x11, REPLACE 0x14, F1 0x1E, F2 0x1F, F3 0x18,
FIELDLEFT 0x0C, FIELDRIGHT 0x17, TABLEFT 0x15, TABRIGHT 0x09, NEWPARA 0x08.

So the key encoder needs a mode bit choosing rule A or rule C.

### Rule D - the numeric pad has a third encoding

Used only in numeric-pad-function mode: KP1 `ESC[69_`, KP2 `ESC[70_`,
KP3 `ESC[71_`, and so on. KPENTER is 0x0D always.

### What is awkward from a PS/2 or MEGA65 keyboard

- **PUSH keys G1-G8 are PROGRAMMABLE with no fixed sequence at all** (flag
  `IsProgrammable`, every sequence null). There is nothing to emit until the
  host defines them. Decide early whether Stage C supports them; ignoring them
  breaks nothing, they simply do nothing.
- **13 Norwegian legends with no PC equivalent** - MERK, FELT, AVSH, SETN,
  ORD, STRYK, KOPI, FLYTT, JUST, SKRIV, HJELP, SLUTT, FUNK - plus shifted
  variants. Needs a modifier layer or a mode key. RetroTerm's answer was a
  user-editable binding table, too much for RTL; **a fixed Alt+letter layer is
  the cheap version.**
- LOKAL (G14) and CAPS (E0) are local toggles that send nothing.
- **The keyboard is addressed by GRID POSITION** (G0, F51, C13, B48...), not
  by legend, because the same physical position carries different legends per
  national variant. Hardcode legends and it has to be redone for every
  national keyboard.

## Attributes - per cell, but the wire protocol is per region

The cell carries a `CharacterAttributes` ushort
(`src\RetroTerm.Core\Terminal\Buffer\CharacterAttributes.cs`): Bold, Dim,
Italic, Underline, Blink, RapidBlink, Reverse, Hidden, Strikethrough,
DoubleWidth, DoubleHeightTop, DoubleHeightBottom, and more above bit 11.

**The interaction that matters for BRAM:** NDSAR (`CSI ... z`) sets an
attribute over a RECTANGLE, and NDSREC/NDRREC save and restore rectangles - so
the wire protocol is region-oriented while the storage is per-cell. Store per
cell and NDSAR is a fill loop; try to store per region to save BRAM and you
fight every other sequence.

First cut per cell: 8 bits character + reverse + underline + blink + dim.
Reverse and underline are what the ND full-screen tools lean on. **Which
attributes SINTRAN actually uses is not measured** - same caveat as Stage A.

Our `char_ram.v` already carries a 16-bit cell (8 character + 8 attribute,
only reverse used so far), so this needs no width change.

## Traps, collected

1. **80x25, not 80x24.**
2. The `_` terminator is outside the ANSI final range - tell the CSI state
   machine, or it never terminates.
3. Shifted = base+1 across the whole key table.
4. Arrows are C0 bytes, not escape sequences.
5. HOME is the only key whose code changes between modes (0x1D vs 0x10).
6. **Two mapper classes that must not be conflated:**
   `Terminal\Input\KeyboardMapper.cs` holds `TDV2200KeyboardMapper`, keyed by
   **VK code** - the one the factory builds;
   `Emulators\TDV\TDVKeyboardMapper.cs` is keyed by key **name**. That
   confusion has cost time in RetroTerm and a memory note there was wrong
   about it for weeks.
7. **No VT100 fallback, deliberately.** A key with no TDV equivalent returns
   null and sends nothing rather than degrading to a VT100 sequence. Add a
   fallback and you send bytes a real TDV never sent.
8. **Escape sequences ARRIVE SPLIT ACROSS READS.** Not theoretical -
   RetroTerm's `InputParser.cs` is a state machine with a 100 ms timeout for
   exactly this reason. Over a UART the same happens, with ESC in one
   byte-time and `[` in the next. **Never write a matcher that needs the whole
   sequence in one buffer.** (A hardware state machine gets this right for
   free - but this is why it must stay a state machine.)
9. If any of this is ever turned into C or C# tables: `"\x1ba"` is ONE
   character, not ESC followed by `a` - the hex escape is greedy and takes as
   many hex digits as it can. Verilog is safe; a generator script is not.
10. Treat the OCR documents and derived guides as **claims**. Three of
    RetroTerm's own documents turned out wrong and two would have hidden a
    real defect. Our own `TDV-Keys.md` misread was the same shape: its §1 is
    about the TDV **1200**, not the 2200.

## Reading order (from retroterm-09)

1. `Terminal\Emulators\TDV\TDV2200KeyRegistry.cs` - the key table, START HERE
2. `Terminal\Emulators\TDV\TDVEmulatorBase.cs` - ND finals, private modes
3. `Terminal\Input\KeyboardMapper.cs` - the VK-keyed mapper the factory builds
4. `Terminal\Buffer\CharacterAttributes.cs` - the attribute bits
5. `Configuration\EmulatorFactory.cs` - geometry per terminal type (line ~200)
6. `Terminal\Parsing\EscapeSequenceParser.cs` - the split-across-reads machine
7. `Protocols.TelnetServer\Parsing\InputParser.cs` - a smaller worked example

**Not** `TerminalEmulatorBase.cs` - it is the enormous ECMA-48 core, and it is
not the TDV story.
