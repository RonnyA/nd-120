# ND-120 CPU

## Content

This repo contains:

* Original **Norsk Data** ND-120 CPU Design Documents from 1988. Scanned in 2023
* Modern Logisim and HDL implementation from 2023.

You can read more about this [CPU](https://www.ndwiki.org/wiki/3202) and much more in [NDWiki](https://www.ndwiki.org/) and the official website for [Norsk Data](http://sintran.com/)

The goal of this repo is to re-create the schematics and create the HDL files so we can program an FPGA to run as the original ND-120 CPU Card.

On the way to the FPGA code, there will be testable Logisim Circuits and Logisim code that can be converted and tested in C++ using Verilator.

## Current Status

### Where the project stands (26-AUG-2026)

The machine runs the original operating system on real hardware - on **two
boards**. **SINTRAN III boots on the Tang Nano 20K** (24-AUG) and on the
**Nexys 4 DDR** (25-AUG), each from a Winchester disc image on an SD card,
and you can log in and run programs. The Tang is the primary target.

Verilator is no longer "the thing that works while hardware doesn't" - it is
the **signal-level reference**: waveforms, unit testbenches, and the
latch-versus-flip-flop comparison that proves a refactor changed nothing. Of
the Xilinx boards only the Basys3 remains OPCOM-only (does not meet timing).

**Simulation (Verilator - the signal-level reference):**
- Microcode loads, Master Clear executes, and the CPU self-test passes
  clean: **0 execution-phase STERR visits** (measured with the
  `ND120_COUNT_STERR` probe in `Verilog/runSim/Run120.cpp`).
  An older status here read "self-test runs, 7 of 14 subtests passing".
  **That figure is retracted** - it predated the fixes and was never
  re-measured (`Verilog/docs/RETRACTED.md`). Careful when measuring: the
  WCS loader walks past the STERR address once while loading, so only
  execution-phase visits count.
- The self-test result is **not** a memory-parity question. Microcode
  analysis proved the self-test never touches memory parity, which is why
  FPGA targets compute parity on the read path instead of storing it
  (`Verilog/docs/nd120-parity-analysis.md`).
- **13 of 13 testable INSTRUCTION-B areas pass** on both layers - each
  area's own end-of-test with zero error lines, and the 400-instruction
  golden-trace comparison against the ND-110 reference
  (`Verilog/tests/instruction-verify/CAMPAIGN-STATUS.md`). The
  48-bit floating area is not applicable: our PROM microcode implements
  the 32-bit float option.
- OPCOM console works; `INSTRUCTION-B` loads and runs from the Verilog
  papertape device; DMA bus mastering against the real arbiter
- Golden-console and latch-vs-FF regression gates keep it all pinned

### TPE diagnostic programs - what actually runs

These are the original Norsk Data test programs, not our own testbenches.
Each row says where the result was measured; nothing here is inferred from
a passing run somewhere else.

| Program | Result | Measured on |
|---|---|---|
| **CONFIGURATION** (`load conf`) | **Passes** - runs to completion with `NO ERRORS DETECTED` and correctly enumerates the machine (ND-120/CX, 32-bit float, MMS-2, cache present, ALD 400B, print number 3202). Version D05, 1988-11-08 | Verilator (logged, 27-JUL-2026); confirmed working on the Tang |
| **INSTRUCTION** | **Passes.** In Verilator, **13 of 13** testable INSTRUCTION-B areas - each area's own deep end-of-test with zero error lines, plus a golden 400-instruction trace gate against the ND-110 reference. On the board, the full multi-level run over interrupt **levels 1-9 passes clean** | Verilator (13-JUL-2026) + Tang silicon (31-JUL-2026) |
| **PAGING** | **Passes 11 of 11**, including test 3 (PGU/WIP), test 4 (alternative PIT) and test 11 (physical address generation) | Tang silicon (30-JUL-2026) |
| **MEMORY** | **Passes.** An earlier open item here - the TPE Monitor's memory diagnostic returning a corrupted banner string (23-JUL) - was closed by the MMU cache fix on 27-JUL: the cache data output was not gated by `HIT`, so a stale line jammed the wired-OR `CD` bus. That is the same defect that produced the garbled `INST??CTION` banner | Tang silicon |
| **TPE Monitor B01** | Boots from a floppy image (`1560&` at the OPCOM `#` prompt), reaches the `TPE>` prompt and accepts its own commands - this is the harness the diagnostics above are loaded and run from | Verilator (27-JUL-2026) + Tang silicon |
| **RUN** | Reaches its `== END OF TEST ==` after the Am2914 interrupt status fence was made default and MOR (memory-out-of-range) was wired to level 12 | Verilator (15-JUL-2026) |
| **48-BITS-FLOATING** | **Not applicable** - this machine's PROM microcode implements the 32-bit float option, so the area cannot apply (`Verilog/docs/48bit-float-not-configured.md`) | - |
| **DISC-TEMA J02** | **Not passing.** Loads and transfers real data off the disc image, register-for-register matching the reference model, but still reports `Memory address Register not as expected`. Unexplained, and the one known open diagnostic | Verilator + Tang silicon |

The four that pass clean on the board - **CONFIGURE, INSTRUCTION, PAGING and
MEMORY** - are the machine's own acceptance suite: they check the CPU
identifies itself correctly, executes every instruction group correctly, that
the MMU translates and faults correctly, and that main memory is sound. With
those green and SINTRAN III booting, the ND-120 is a working machine rather
than a partially working one.

These campaigns are also what found the real CPU bugs, which is the argument
for running the original diagnostics rather than only our own testbenches:
INSTRUCTION caught a multiply bug (every product's low word was zero) and a
shift-control bug (all rotate and sign-extending shifts ran as plain shifts);
PAGING caught an MMU fault where the physical-page map RAM was never written
at all; CONFIGURATION caught a trap-vector generator that resolved a
simultaneous page-fault-plus-PGU to an unimplemented vector and self-jumped
forever.

**FPGA hardware:**

> **Ready-built bitstreams:** grab them from the
> [Releases page](https://github.com/RonnyA/nd-120/releases) - no FPGA
> toolchain needed. Quickstarts: `Verilog/fpga/QUICKSTART-nexys4ddr.md`
> (incl. the no-software SD-card path) and
> `Verilog/fpga/QUICKSTART-tang-nano-20k.md`.

- **Tang Nano 20K - SINTRAN III BOOTS (24-AUG-2026).** The operating system
  runs on the FPGA from a Winchester disc image on the SD card: banner in
  **29.4 s**, login, `LIST-FILES`, and the S3 program (cold start 13.2 s).
  Full CPU bitstream with **4 MB SDRAM main memory** (packed 16-bit storage,
  computed parity - `ND_SDRAM_PACK16`), the other 4 MB for the SD disk-image
  cache; SD/FAT stack proven on hardware (read + write, safety-gated).
  **Clocked up 26-AUG-2026: the `fast20` variant boots SINTRAN at
  20.25 MHz with a 115200 console, timing-clean (TNS 0)** - 3x the
  long-validated 6.75 MHz. Timings and clock variants:
  `Verilog/fpga/tang-nano-20k/README.md`.
- **Nexys 4 DDR - SINTRAN III BOOTS (25-AUG-2026), clocked up to
  45.45 MHz with a 115200 console (26-AUG-2026), SD-card deployment
  end to end (27-AUG-2026: the board configures itself from the microSD
  and boots from the same card - no PC software).** Full CPU, deployed at
  **45.45 MHz** (50 MHz also booted; frequency search and bottleneck
  analysis in `Verilog/fpga/nexys4ddr/timing.md`), main memory in **DDR2
  through a BRAM cache** (`MEM_RAM_49_DDR2`), boot disc on the on-board
  microSD:
  banner in ~40 s, console login verified, 7/7 boot cycles. The blocker
  was a dropped cache-hit update on late DDR2 write strobes - root cause,
  fix and validation in `Verilog/fpga/nexys4ddr/SINTRAN-BOOT-25AUG.md`.
  The board carries a debug panel (RGB health LEDs incl. a DDR2 watchdog,
  8-digit live state display): `Verilog/fpga/nexys4ddr/DEBUG-PANEL.md`.
- **Basys3**: OPCOM boots on the board (tag `fpga-opcom-working-basys3`);
  active debug line at 16.67 MHz. Does not meet timing (WNS -29.778 ns at
  16.667 MHz, measured 21-AUG-2026), so it does not boot the OS.
- **Dual toolchain**: the Tang builds with the OSS CAD Suite
  (yosys/nextpnr, primary) and Gowin EDA (backup) - all clock variants;
  nextpnr closes the full 27/54 MHz target with >2x margin
  (`Verilog/docs/tang20k-build-flows.md`)
- **Cmod A7-35T**: first build ready (BRAM memory, CPU at 27 MHz);
  512 KB SRAM main-memory bridge planned
  (`Verilog/fpga/cmod-a7-35t/SRAM-BRIDGE-PLAN.md`)
- Memory-backend speed rules for every board (what meets the no-wait-state
  protocol at 40 MHz and what cannot):
  `Verilog/docs/basys3-memory-speed-validation.md`

## History

The compressed history of the work progress has moved to [HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md).

## Design documents

All the design documents are in the [Design Documents](DesignDocuments/Readme.md) folder.

## Norsk Data documents

Functional Description, Instruction set, Microprogramming guide and more are in the [NorskData-Doc](NorskData-Doc/Readme.md) folder.

## Microcode

The [Microcode](Code/Microcode/readme.md) dump is from a ND-120 3202 CPU Board is Version 14/L
The source code is also for the L version.

## Panel Controller - 6805 CPU CHIP

[ROM dump](Code/68705/readme.md)

The ND-120/CX CPU Board has an on-board MC68705-U3 CPU.

The physical front panel also has an MC68705 CPU, however this chip is not identical to the on on the 3202D CPU Board - its an MC68705-P3 with fewer I/O pins.

The MC68705 is an MC 6805 8-bit CPU with on-chip RAM, I/O and Timer. [Motorola 68HC05](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_68HC05)

* P3 version = 28 pins, 2x 8 bits I/O ports, 1x 4 bit I/O port
* U3 version = 40 pins, 4x 8 bits I/O ports

We have a ROM dumps from both the *MC68705-U3* chip (from the 3202D CPU Board) and the *MC68705-P3* (from an ND-5000C panel controller).

**Big thanks to Matthieu Benoit for reading the data out of the chips**

Reverse engineering has been done using the free SRE tool [GHIDRA](https://ghidra-sre.org/) from NSA.

## Schematic drawings

### Logisim

All the Logisim files are stored in the [Logisim folder](Logisim/readme.md)

#### Logisim Requirements

You need to install the Logisim-Evolution design tool from [Logisim Evolution Repository](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution)

The Logisim diagrams has been drawn with [Version 3.8.0](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution/releases/tag/v3.8.0)

## FPGA

### FPGA Hardware

The project targets several FPGA boards, each with its own folder of build
scripts, pin constraints, vendor documentation and bring-up plans under
[Verilog/fpga/](Verilog/fpga/README.md).

**For the current per-board FPGA status, target line-up and priority order,
see [Verilog/fpga/README.md](Verilog/fpga/README.md).**

### Verilog

Most Verilog files were originally generated from the Logisim drawings using the
Logisim-Evolution FPGA tools. They are **no longer regenerated** - the Verilog and
the schematics are now both maintained by hand, so a fix has to be made in both
places.

All the Verilog files are stored in the [Verilog folder](Verilog/)

### Verilator

To test the Verilog code using Verilator you need to install the [Verilator](https://www.veripool.org/verilator/) tool
