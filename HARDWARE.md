## Memory Architecture

### Microcode Memory

**Organization**:
- **Total Size**: 64KB, split low half + high half
- **Word Width**: 64 bits
- **Technology**: EPROM, AM27256 (the dumps used by the build are
  `AM27256_45132L.hex` and `AM27256_45133L.hex`, microcode version L)
- **Access Time**: <150ns (unverified against the original data sheet)

The hex address map that stood here was internally inconsistent (it labelled
2KB ranges as 32KB) and is not reproduced. For the real control-store layout see
`Verilog/mic-calculation.md` and the microcode listing under `Code/Microcode/`.

**Microcode Fields**:
- **ALU Control**: 9 bits (CSALUI[8:0])
- **Register Select**: 4 bits (CSRASEL, CSRBSEL)
- **Memory Control**: 5 bits (CSCOMM[4:0])
- **Sequencing**: 16 bits (next address, conditions)
- **Miscellaneous**: 30 bits (various control)

### Main Memory

**Dynamic RAM**:
- **Technology**: 4164/41256 series DRAM
- **Organization**: 16-bit words
- **Capacity**: Up to 8MB
- **Refresh**: Every 2ms
- **Access Time**: 150-200ns

**Static RAM**:

### I/O Address Map

The ND-120 does not use a hex memory-mapped I/O window. Devices are reached with
the `IOX` instruction using **octal device addresses** (for example the floppy /
streamer controller at `1560`). The hex table that stood here was never traced to
any Norsk Data source and has been removed rather than left as fact. The authoritative
per-device addresses are in the Norsk Data functional descriptions under
`NorskData-Doc/`, and in the device models under `Verilog/ND-BUS-DEVICES/`.

#### What THIS Verilog actually implements: 115200 8N1, and no parity at all

**Connect your terminal as 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit. NOT 7E1.**

The four lines above describe what the real SC2661 chip could be programmed to do. They are not
what `Verilog/Shared/support/SC2661_UART.v` does, and reading them as a terminal setting is how a
whole evening got lost on 30 August 2026 — a PC was set to 7E1 against this UART, the PC's driver
then validated a parity bit that is never sent, and every character it judged bad came back as a
question mark sprinkled through the text.

The mode registers that would select character length and parity are **not implemented**. From the
file's own comment, line 108:

```verilog
/*******************************************************************************
 ** Mode register 1 and 2 bits                                                 **
 *******************************************************************************/
// Not implemented, we use constant 9600 8N1, or later 115200 8N1
```

The state machines agree with the comment rather than merely asserting it:

- **Transmit**: `IDLE → START_BIT → WRITE → STOP_BIT → DONE`. `TX_STATE_WRITE` shifts out
  `txBitNumber` 0 through 7 (`if (txBitNumber == 3'b111)`), then goes straight to `STOP_BIT`.
- **Receive**: `IDLE → START_BIT → READ_WAIT → READ → STOP_BIT → DONE`. `RX_STATE_READ` shifts in
  8 bits (`if (rxBitNumber == 3'b111)`), then goes straight to `STOP_BIT`.
- **Neither machine has a parity state**, and the word "parity" does not appear anywhere in the
  file. No parity bit is generated on transmit and none is checked on receive.

So the framing is fixed in hardware: **8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit.** Only the baud rate is
configurable, through the defines:

```verilog
`define BOARD_CLK_FREQ 100_000_000   // 100 MHz (Basys3/Arty)
`define UART_BAUD_RATE 115_200       // clocks-per-bit = BOARD_CLK_FREQ / UART_BAUD_RATE
```

#### Why setting a terminal to 7E1 corrupts the text

A terminal told to expect even parity samples the **8th data bit** in the parity position. For
7-bit ASCII that bit is 0, so any character with an odd number of set bits fails the check. What
happens then is the terminal's business, and the two behave differently:

- **PuTTY / TeraTerm** and the FPGA's own VGA console show the text clean.
- **A .NET `System.IO.Ports` program** substitutes a replacement byte for the failed character.
  `SerialPort.ParityReplace` defaults to **63**, which is `?` — so the failures arrive as question
  marks embedded in the data, looking exactly like characters the ND sent.

Measured on real hardware, same wire, same command:

| Reader | Framing | Bytes | `?` |
|---|---|---|---|
| pyserial | 7E1 | 42 | 0 |
| .NET, `ParityReplace=63` (its default) | 7E1 | 48 | 6 |
| .NET, `ParityReplace=0` | 7E1 | 42 | 0 |
| pyserial / .NET | 8N1 | 42 | 0 |

**Not fully explained:** that model predicts a failure on nearly every odd-population character,
which would shred the text. In the capture only 6 of 42 bytes came back as `?`, clustered around
the echo and the prompts. The framing mismatch is verified from this source file; the exact rate
and clustering are not, and pinning them down would need a controlled capture.
