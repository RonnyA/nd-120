# Design Documents

This folder contains multiple subfolders that keeps different design documents.

The design documents are scanned with 600 DPI and OCR'ed.
(The scan is mostly good, but some pages have areas that is very hard to read. Sorry about that, but I wasn't able to get a better scan)

* [DELILAH CPU](DELILAH-CPU/DELILAH.pdf) - 106 page design document for the CPU.
* [Decode Gate Array](DECODE-GateArray/Readme.md)
* [CPU Board 3202](CPU-BOARD-3202/Readme.md)
* [PAL Code](PAL-Code/Readme.md) - PAL 
* [Other - including PAL's](Other/Readme.md)
