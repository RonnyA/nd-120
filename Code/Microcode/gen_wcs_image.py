Generate a pre-loaded Writable Control Store (WCS) image from the two ND-120
microcode PROM hex files, so the WCS can be $readmemh'd directly and the runtime
WCS-load phase (LCS_n sequence) can be skipped.

Full path: /mnt/e/Dev/Repos/Ronny/nd-120/Code/Microcode/gen_wcs_image.py

Data mapping (verified against RTL):
  - AM27256_45132L.hex = LO byte (bits 7:0),  AM27256_45133L.hex = HI byte (15:8)
  - PROM byte index      idx = LUA*4 + RF          (s_Address = {LUA_12_0, RF_1_0})
  - 16-bit PROM read     P(LUA,RF) = (hi[idx]<<8) | lo[idx]
  - 64-bit microword     word[LUA] = { P(RF=3), P(RF=2), P(RF=1), P(RF=0) }
                         RF=0 -> bits[15:0] ... RF=3 -> bits[63:48]  (no remap)
  - WCS geometry: 2 banks x 16 nibble chips (IDT6168A, 4096x4).
      bank C (16C..31C) = lower, LUA 0..4095 ; bank D (16D..31D) = upper, 4096..8191
      chip (16+j) holds bits [63-4j : 60-4j]  (16 -> [63:60], 31 -> [3:0])

Outputs (into ./wcs/, or ./wcs-sim/ with --sim):
  - wcs_image.hex        : 8192 lines x 16 hex digits (unified, for inspection /
                           a single-BRAM WCS rewrite)
  - wcs_<16..31><C|D>.hex : 32 files x 4096 lines x 1 hex nibble (per IDT6168A chip)

Two variants, DECIDED by Ronny 02-SEP-2026 ("raw on FPGA, patched in sims"):
  - default (no flag) -> ./wcs/     : the RAW PROM microcode, byte for byte the
                                      real ND-120. This is what every BOARD
                                      preloads (Nexys, Tang, Basys3, MEGA65, and
                                      the MiSTer via Verilog/Shared/support).
  - --sim             -> ./wcs-sim/ : the run-simulator variant with the PATCHES
                                      below applied, equal to the patched
                                      AM27256_45133L.hex the Verilator harnesses
                                      (Verilog/sim, runSim, dmaSim) load at
                                      runtime. Only for SKIP_WCS=1 sim runs.

    # SIMULATOR MICROCODE PATCH (--sim only; applied since 07-DEC-2024 to
    # every Verilator harness copy - commit 895f360 "Need pacthed hex files
    # for the run-simulator"; decoded 02-SEP-2026): microword 0o2002 (MACL+1)
    # with RF0 bits 14:13 cleared. Those bits are part of the A-OPERAND
    # field (RF0 bits 15:12): the PROM word says "A,6", the patched word
    # "A,0". The word is "A,6 B,R1 ALUF,PASSD ALUD,B IDBS,BMG" - the
    # bit-mask generator (1 << A) loads scratch register R1 with the OUTER
    # count of the master-clear wait loop (listing 001777-002003, "% WAITING
    # LOOP 0.5 - 1 SECOND": 64 passes of a 65536-step inner loop). Patched,
    # R1 = 1, so the power-on wait is 64x shorter. It is a simulation
    # speed-up, NOT a bug fix: the raw word is the real ND-120 microcode and
    # boots SINTRAN on the MiSTer and the Tang (Verilog/docs/nd120-facts.md).
