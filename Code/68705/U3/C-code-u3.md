# C code emualtion of the U3 chip

I have successfully created a comprehensive C code emulation of the Motorola 68705 ND-120 Performance Monitor firmware based on the Ghidra disassembly analysis with help from Claude.AI

**The code does not compile, so its a RAW output from the Ghidra/AI - and is meant for inspiration - not for compile.**
Maybe in the future I will make it compilable.

## Source

* C code

* Include
[u3.h](u3_code/u3.h)

## Here's what the emulation includes:

Key Features Implemented:

### 1. Hardware Architecture Emulation

MC68705 registers: PORTA-PORTD, DDRx, Timer (TDR/TCR), Control registers
Memory layout: Complete RAM mapping from 0x0010-0x007F
Port D signal monitoring: ND-120 CPU status (Ring, PONI/IONI, LEV0, LHIT, cache hits)
Timer system: 1200Hz interrupt simulation (38.4kHz รท 32 prescaler)

### 2. PANC Command Processing

All 8 command types (0-7) from the disassembly:

Set time/date (5 bytes)
Set time only (4 bytes)
Read CPU status (2 bytes)
Set display mode (3 bytes)
Load ROM characters (1 byte)
Set system config (1 byte)
Set display data (4 bytes)
System control/soft reset (2 bytes)



### 3. Real-Time Performance Monitoring

CPU utilization calculation from ND-120 status signals
Ring level tracking (privilege levels 0-3)
Cache hit monitoring via LHIT signal
System protection status (PONI/IONI flags)
15-sample sliding window for performance history

### 4. Display System

7-segment display processing with bit manipulation
ROM character table lookup (tables at 0x0D12, 0x0D1A)
Multiple display modes and formatting
Real-time status updates

### 5. MM58274 RTC Interface

Hardware initialization sequence
Software RTC counters (tenths, seconds, minutes, hours)
Port C communication simulation
333ms hierarchical timing

### 6. Faithful Code Structure

Exact function entry points from disassembly addresses
Preserved control flow and branching logic
Accurate bit manipulations and register operations
Original variable names and memory locations
Complete interrupt handling structure

## Notable Technical Details:

The emulation preserves the dual-clock architecture:

4MHz CPU clock for fast command processing
38.4kHz timer clock for precise performance sampling
1200Hz interrupt rate for real-time monitoring

The FIFO interface simulation handles both:

LDPANC microcode: ND-120 command loading
EPANS microcode: Status reading and response

The soft reset capability (command 7 with parameter 0x4X) demonstrates the sophisticated system recovery mechanisms.
Usage:
The emulator provides a complete functional simulation that can:

Process actual PANC commands as they would appear from ND-120 software
Monitor simulated CPU activity and generate performance statistics
Display real-time status including CPU utilization and ring distribution
Handle timer interrupts for continuous background monitoring

This represents a strictly accurate reconstruction of the original firmware behavior without any functional speculation beyond what's directly observable in the disassembly.
